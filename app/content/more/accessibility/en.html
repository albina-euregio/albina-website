      Pursuant to Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1523 of 11 October
      2018 establishing a model accessibility statement in accordance with
      Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council on
      barrier-free access to the websites and mobile applications of public
      sector bodies.

    <h4>
      Declaration on accessibility
    </h4>

    <p>
      The Office of the Tyrolean Regional Government endeavours to make its
      website accessible in accordance with Section 14b of the Tyrolean
      Anti-Discrimination Act 2005 implementing Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2016 on barrier-free
      access to the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies (OJ
      L 327, 2.12.2016, p. 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      This accessibility statement applies to "Avalanche.report" |
      "Avalanche.report" | "Valanghe.report".
    </p>

    <h4>Status of compatibility with the requirements</h4>

    <p>
      This website is partially compliant with compliance level AA of the "Web
      Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG 2.1" according to the applicable
      harmonised European standard "European Standard EN 301 549 V2.1.2
      (2018-08)" due to the following incompatibilities.
    </p>

    <h5>Non-accessible content</h5>

    <p>
      The content listed below is not accessible for the following reasons:<br />
    </p>

    <h6>
      1. Incompatibility with Web Accessibility Act (WZG) transposing Directive
      (EU) 2016/2102.
    </h6>

    <h7>1.1 Perceptibility</h7>

    <p>
      For some images in blog entries the alternative text is missing, so this
      information is not accessible for screen reader users. This means that
      WCAG success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content) is not met. All new images
      are published together with alternative text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some pages are missing level 2, 3, 4 and 5 headings, thus WCAG success
      criteria 1.3.1 (info and relationships) is not met. We plan to fix the
      problem in 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      On some pages, the minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 of text and images of
      text is not met. This means that WCAG success criterion 1.3.3 Contrast
      (minimum) is not met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Images and graphics are used to provide weather and climate content in a
      compact and effective way. For technical reasons and due to the high
      update rates of the files to be visualised, we are not able to design all
      illustrations and graphics in an accessible and barrier-free manner and in
      these cases do not fulfil success criterion 1.1.1 (text alternative). This
      includes animated weather forecasts and analyses.
    </p>

    <h6>2. Disproportionate burden</h6>

    <p>
      Our videos do not have audio description. This means that WCAG success
      criterion 1.2.5 (audio description recorded) is not met. The content of
      the video is available in textual form directly with the videos.
    </p>
