      Passionate backcountry recreationists from Tirol, South Tyrol and Trentino
      are discovering more and more tours throughout the so-called Euregio. In
      order to guarantee maximum safety, avalanche warning services from the
      three states/provinces Tirol, South Tyrol and Trentino have joined forces
      to publish a joint, multilingual and cross-border avalanche forecast for
      the 2018-2019 winter season. In addition, there will also be maps of snow
      and new snow height, air temperature and wind.

    <h2>The idea: a common project</h2>
    <p>
      For some time now there has been the idea of bringing the avalanche
      warning services of the so-called Euregio region closer together. Since
      January 2017 the Interreg project ALBINA Euregio-Avalanche Bulletin on the
      Interreg project Italia-Austria was approved and work on this project
      started.<br />The project's main goal is the realization of a joint
      multilingual avalanche forecast designed to daily inform citizens about
      the avalanche situation in the entire Euregio territory. In order to
      achieve this, the project aims at standardizing the work of the avalanche
      forecasters through a unified workflow based on EAWS standards for the
      preparation of the avalanche forecast while organizing apposite periodic
      training. Communication structures developed within the project will
      promote and facilitate the exchange of information among experts of the
      three territories, thanks to a software system that will display the
      weather station data, observations, snow profiles and avalanche activity
      of the whole region and will enable publishing of the common avalanche
      forecast. <br />The exchange of information will occur through
      standardized interfaces and formats that will facilitate future extensions
      and connections. The Euregio avalanche forecast will be presented on a
      website in an intuitive and uniform way thanks to optimized mapping and
      descriptions based on predefined text blocks. Standardized interfaces with
      the media and social networks will facilitate the broadcast of the
      forecast. All data will be freely accessible thus supporting the Open Data
      initiative. This first cross-border avalanche forecast is a decisive step
      forward in risk prevention and management in the Euregio territory.

    <h2>The project partners</h2>
    <p>
      The Euregio region Tirol, South Tyrol, Trentino (EGTC) developed the
      project together with the Avalanche Warning Services of the Province of
      Tyrol, the Autonomous Provinces of Bolzano-South Tyrol and Trento and the
      University of Vienna and submitted it to the administrative authority of
      Bolzano on 6 June 2016 for funding under the INTERREG V-A programme
      Italy-Austria. The project was approved at the meeting of the Monitoring
      Committee on 27-28 September 2016.

          The European Region Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino directly expresses the
          cross-border cooperation by interlinking the most different areas of
          life such as transport, agriculture, education or culture of the three
          states/provinces. The idea of deepening political, economic and
          cultural life is applied in practice and leads to numerous fruitful
          projects.

        <p>
          The Avalanche Warning Service Tirol is part of the Department for
          Civil Protection and Disaster Control and has been informing the
          public about the current snow and avalanche situation in the Tyrolean
          Mountains for more than 50 years. The Avalanche Warning Service
          collects, evaluates and interprets a wide range of information on snow
          cover and weather. All information and interpretations ultimately lead
          to the central warning product of the Avalanche Warning Service, the
          avalanche forecast.

          data, snow profiles and observations are analyzed and evaluated.
          Combined with the weather forecasts of the Provincial Weather Service,
          a daily forecast of the avalanche danger is published in the winter
          season.
