    <p>Typical avalanche problems and danger patterns have one thing in common:&#13;
      they point to typical, repetitive and usually obvious danger&#13;
      situations.<br>The difference lies in the level of observation. While&#13;
      avalanche problems give an initial rough overview of possible sources of&#13;
      danger (e.g. new snow), danger patterns immerse deeper into the processes&#13;
      within the snowpack and focus on the causes of the problem (e.g. problem&#13;
      due to excessive new snow load on a weak layer). Danger patterns thus&#13;
      describe different scenarios or processes that lead to the respective&#13;
      avalanche problem.<br>The goal is clear: dangerous situations should be&#13;
      recognized quickly with the help of the avalanche problems and danger&#13;
      patterns. In that way, recreationsist may adapt their behavior accordingly&#13;
      and thereby may avoid avalanche accidents.<br>The 10 decisive danger&#13;
      patterns (dp) are presented on this page including a short video for each&#13;
      dp.</p>&#13;

    <p>At the onset of winter, slab avalanches are often observed following the&#13;
      second heavy snowfall, usually at high altitudes (&gt;2000 m) and high alpine&#13;
      altitudes (&gt;3000 m) on shady, very steep slopes. This is because in autumn&#13;
      after the first big snowfalls, a lengthy period of stable, highpressure&#13;
      weather or at least precipitation-free weather frequently follows. That is&#13;
      when ideal conditions prevail for the partial metamorphism of snow into&#13;
      loose crystals, which then form a deep persistent weak layer for&#13;
      subsequent snowfall to be deposited on. During the course of early winter,&#13;
      this can occur in a wide range of altitudes and aspects. In general, deep&#13;
      persistent weak layers formed in early winter are triggered by skiers and&#13;
      freeriders at the beginning of the season, but it is also possible later&#13;
      on in winters with little snowfall. This occurs especially in spring when&#13;
      deep persistent weak layers are weakened further by water.</p>&#13;

&#13;
    <p>Snow glides most easily towards the valley across steep, smooth surfaces.&#13;
      While this process is taking place, glide cracks – easily visible,&#13;
      sometimes several-meters deep cracks in the snowpack surface – are formed.&#13;
      Such fissures are now considered to be not the favorable signs which&#13;
      ancient folk knowledge once posited (such traditions are hard to overcome)&#13;
      but instead, utterly unfavorable indicators of potential, sometimes&#13;
      imminent avalanches. A glide crack points to the possibility of a&#13;
      glide-snow avalanche without giving any indication if or when such a&#13;
      glide-snow avalanche will actually release. Regarding their timing,&#13;
      glide-snow avalanches number among the most difficult avalanches of all to&#13;
      predict, since they can trigger literally at any time of day or night,&#13;
      even when the snow situation is at its most stable. That includes the&#13;
      coldest day and the warmest day of the winter. Furthermore, glide-snow&#13;
      avalanches are not triggered by additional loading.</p>&#13;

&#13;
    <p>Rain-on-snow is considered the classic alarm signal in snow and avalanche&#13;
      science because, on the one hand, its additional weight burdens the entire&#13;
      snowpack; and on the other, because the firmness of the snowpack is&#13;
      immediately lost. For those reasons, avalanches are predestined. Rain can&#13;
      occur at any time during the winter. The big advantage is that no danger&#13;
      sign could be simpler to recognize.</p>&#13;

&#13;
    <p>A theory purporting that huge temperature disparities during snowfall&#13;
      (regardless whether cold on warm or warm on cold) exercise a positive&#13;
      effect on the avalanche situation held sway for much too long in avalanche&#13;
      science. In fact, this is the case only under certain very specific prior&#13;
      conditions. For the most part, such temperature differences have a&#13;
      negative effect, since they reinforce snow metamorphism inside the&#13;
      snowpack. As a rule, a thin, weak layer forms which is highly prone to&#13;
      triggering. This layer is often found on south-facing slopes. It is highly&#13;
      treacherous for the additional reason that the weak layer does not yet&#13;
      exist immediately after the new snow is deposited, it forms only over the&#13;
      course of the following days.</p>&#13;

    <p>Among avalanche events, this is a classic: following a lengthy period of&#13;
      cold, it begins to snow. In addition, strong winds prevail which transport&#13;
      the new snow accordingly. Within the shortest imaginable time, a&#13;
      treacherous situation arises for backcountry skiers. This is also the case&#13;
      if, following a lengthy period of cold, “only” strong winds are blowing&#13;
      without snowfall. The problem is that fresh snowdrifts are deposited on&#13;
      wind-protected leeward slopes on top of a loose old snow cover surface&#13;
      which usually contains depth hoar. Wind-drifted snow and persistent weak&#13;
      layers are very poorly bonded with each other. The snowpack is just&#13;
      waiting to be triggered by additional loading.</p>&#13;

    </div>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>“Wind is the architect of avalanches.” This classic proverb from the 1930s&#13;
      by Wilhelm Paulcke remains unchanged even today. Wind influences both snow&#13;
      which is falling and snow which has already been deposited. It is a major&#13;
      factor in the formation of avalanches. When the snow is loose and dry,&#13;
      wind transports it, thereby increasing avalanche danger. The colder the&#13;
      transported snow, the more sensitively it reacts to additional loading,&#13;
      because it is so brittle. It is characteristic of this danger pattern that&#13;
      the weak layer usually consists of new snow and is buried by snowdrifts.&#13;
      Thus, there must have been snowfall at low temperatures without wind&#13;
      impact either just before or in a previous period when the drifting began;&#13;
      or else the snowfall set in without wind influence, but winds arose during&#13;
      the snowfall. This is a pattern which ordinarily can be recognized with&#13;
      ease and lasts only for a short time. The exception is a situation in&#13;
      which the old snowpack surface consisting of loose, faceted crystals is&#13;
      itself transported by wind. When that happens, hard, brittle slabs form&#13;
      which remain prone to triggering for a lengthy period.</p>&#13;

&#13;
    <p>Areas where the snow is shallow usually have less favorable snowpack&#13;
      layering than where the snow is deep. This is because of amplified&#13;
      transformation processes which go on inside a shallow snowpack.&#13;
      Furthermore, slab avalanches are easier to trigger where the snow is&#13;
      shallow because the weak layers are not as deeply embedded in the&#13;
      snowpack, thus are more liable to trigger through additional loading. For&#13;
      that reason, avalanche triggerings are often observed in transition zones&#13;
      from shallow snow to deep snow. This occurs frequently near terrain edges,&#13;
      and repeatedly on broad ridges.</p>&#13;

    <p>A weak layer inside a snowpack is often compared with ball bearings. This&#13;
      image is actually suitable only for graupel: a spherical, granular form of&#13;
      precipitation which is often deposited during showers such as&#13;
      thunderstorms during springtime. It is easy to grasp that snowdrifts&#13;
      accumulating atop of a layer of graupel can only be poorly bonded with it,&#13;
      so that the danger of avalanches increases. Graupel is frequently spread&#13;
      over very small surface areas. Without examining the snowpack itself it is&#13;
      difficult to spot, even for professionals. This is an extremely&#13;
      treacherous phenomenon. Fortunately, the problems it creates are&#13;
      short-lived.</p>&#13;

    <p>Springtime presents a particularly delicate challenge to backcountry&#13;
      skiers and boarders, as well as to members of avalanche commissions.&#13;
      Rarely do states of “safe” and “unsafe” lie quite so near in time to each&#13;
      other. Thus, the span of danger levels, which occur within the course of&#13;
      one single day is wide ranging. On the one hand, avalanche danger is never&#13;
      easier to evaluate than in stable corn-snow conditions; on the other,&#13;
      avalanches of such magnitude as in springtime are rarely registered in&#13;
      deep winter. Apart from the snowpack layering, the complex interaction of&#13;
      air temperature, air moisture, solar radiation and wind play a major role.&#13;
      For backcountry skiers and boarders, high discipline in timing and&#13;
      flexibility of route planning are more essential than ever.</p>&#13;
