    <p>In the every day life we recognize people who we have already met before.&#13;
      The recognition happens in a few seconds, without any long thoughts and&#13;
      usually is correct. For persons we have memorized and know well can, this&#13;
      process of recognition works with less detailled characteristics, e.g.&#13;
      silhouette, gait or voice. In other words, we are made for pattern&#13;
      recognition. In fact, we can also use this ability to recognize similar&#13;
      situations when making decisions in avalanche terrain. The five typical&#13;
      avalanche problems were defined with this goal in mind. They describe&#13;
      typical situations, how they occur in the terrain and how they can support&#13;
      both avalanche forecasters and backcountry recreationists in their&#13;
      assessment of the avalanche danger. They supplement the description of the&#13;
      danger level and the hazardous terrain (aspect and elevation) and&#13;
      represent the third part of the information pyramid. The following&#13;
      definitions contain a description of the problem including the expected&#13;
      avalanche types, the spatial distribution and the position of the weak&#13;
      layers within the snow cover. In addition, the trigger mechanisms, typical&#13;
      duration of the danger and final advice on how to travel in avalanche&#13;
      terrain are discussed. The main focus here is on backcountry&#13;
      recreationists who move in avalanche terrain. In addition, the description&#13;
      of avalanche problems can also be helpful for local authorities (e.g.&#13;
      avalanche commissions).</p>&#13;

      <h2>New Snow</h2>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>What?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Characteristics</h5>&#13;
    <p>The avalanche problem is related to current or most recent snowfall. The&#13;
      amount of additional loading by new snow onto the existing snowpack is the&#13;
      crucial factor of the new snow problem. How critical the loading is&#13;
      depends on various factors such as temperature or characteristics of the&#13;
      old snow surface.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Expected avalanche types</h5>&#13;
    <ul>
<li>Dry-snow slab avalanches</li>&#13;
      <li>Dry loose snow avalanches</li>&#13;
      <li>Natural and human triggered avalanches</li>&#13;
    </ul>
<h6>Where?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Spatial distribution</h5>&#13;
    <p>Generally widely present and often in all aspects.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Position of weak layers in the snowpack</h5>&#13;
    <p>Usually at the transition to the old snow surface, but sometimes in the&#13;
      new snow layers and sometimes also deeper in the old snowpack.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Why?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Release characteristic</h5>&#13;
    <p>Dry-snow slab avalanches:<br>&#13;
      Additional load due to snowfall on existing or newly created weak layers&#13;
      <br>&#13;
      Dry loose snow avalanches: <br>&#13;
      Lack of cohesion between the new snow particles</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>When?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Duration</h5>&#13;
    <p>Typically during snowfall and up to a few days after.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>How to manage?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Identification of the problem in the field</h5>&#13;
    <p>The new snow problem is fairly easy to recognize. Watch out for new snow&#13;
      amounts and recent avalanche activity. Be aware of slight weather changes&#13;
      (e.g., changes in air humidity) affecting new snow conditions.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Travel advice</h5>&#13;
    <p>Dry-snow slab avalanches: <br>&#13;
      Wait until the snowpack stabilizes. <br>&#13;
      Dry loose snow avalanches: <br>&#13;
      Danger of falling is more important than danger of burial. Consider&#13;
      consequences in steep terrain.</p>&#13;

      <h2>Wind-drifted snow</h2>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>What?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Characteristics</h5>&#13;
    <p>The avalanche problem is related to wind-drifted snow. Snow can be&#13;
      transported by wind with or without a concurrent snowfall.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Expected avalanche types</h5>&#13;
    <ul>
<li>Dry-snow slab avalanches</li>&#13;
      <li>Natural and human triggered avalanches</li>&#13;
    </ul>
<h6>Where?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Spatial distribution</h5>&#13;
    <p>Highly variable but typically on leeward sides in gullies, bowls, near&#13;
      distinct changes in slope angle, behind ridgelines or other wind-sheltered&#13;
      locations. More common above treeline.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Position of weak layers in the snowpack</h5>&#13;
    <p>Usually at the transition to the old snow surface or within the windslab&#13;
      layer due to variation in wind speed and variation during storm cycle, but&#13;
      occasionally also deeper in the old snow cover.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Why?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Release characteristics</h5>&#13;
    <p>Wind-drifted snow is an additional load on a weak layer and builds a slab&#13;
      which is particularly prone to support crack propagation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>When?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Duration</h5>&#13;
    <p>Wind-drifted snow can evolve very quickly. The problem lasts typically&#13;
      during the snowdrift event, up to a few days at most, depending on&#13;
      snowpack evolution.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>How to manage?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Identification of the problem in the field</h5>&#13;
    <p>If not hidden by new snow the wind-drifted snow problem can be recognized&#13;
      with training and good visibility. Consider wind signs and locate&#13;
      deposits. Typical clues: snowdrift deposits, recent avalanche activity and&#13;
      sometimes shooting cracks or whumps. However, it is often hard to&#13;
      determine the age of wind signs and wind signs do not necessarily imply an&#13;
      avalanche problem (e.g., in absence of a weak layer).</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Travel advice</h5>&#13;
    <p>Avoid snowdrift deposits in steep terrain, in particular in areas where&#13;
      the snow cover changes from thin to thick or from hard to soft.</p>&#13;

      <h2>Persistent weak layers</h2>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>What?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Characteristics</h5>&#13;
    <p>The avalanche problem is related to the presence of persistent weak layers&#13;
      in the old snowpack. These weak layers typically include buried surface&#13;
      hoar, depth hoar or faceted crystals.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Expected avalanche types</h5>&#13;
    <ul>
<li>Dry-snow slab avalanches</li>&#13;
      <li>Mostly human triggered avalanches; natural avalanches are rare, mainly&#13;
        in combination with other avalanche problems</li>&#13;
    </ul>
<h6>Where?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Spatial distribution</h5>&#13;
    <p>The avalanche problem can be widespread or quite isolated. It can exist in&#13;
      all aspects, but is more frequent on shady, wind sheltered slopes.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Position of weak layers in the snowpack</h5>&#13;
    <p>Anywhere in the old snowpack, often deep in the snowpack. However, when&#13;
      deeply buried triggering becomes increasingly hard.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Why?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Release characteristics</h5>&#13;
    <p>Release of avalanche when loading exceeds the strength of the weak layer.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>When?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Duration</h5>&#13;
    <p>Weak layers can persist for weeks to months; possibly most of the winter&#13;
      season.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>How to manage?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Identification of the problem in the field</h5>&#13;
    <p>Persistent weak layers are very challenging to recognize. Signs of&#13;
      instability such as whumps are typical but not necessarily present.&#13;
      Stability tests can be helpful to detect the persistent weak layers.&#13;
      Information on snowpack history is critical and reference to the published&#13;
      avalanche report is important. Crack propagation over long distances is&#13;
      common and remote triggering is possible.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Travel advice</h5>&#13;
    <p>Travel conservatively and avoid large steep slopes. Consider the history&#13;
      of weather and snow cover processes in the area. Be extra cautious in&#13;
      areas with a thin snowpack and at the transition from thin to deep&#13;
      snowpack. This problem is a major cause of recreational avalanche&#13;
      fatalities.</p>&#13;

      <h2>Wet snow</h2>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>What?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Characteristics</h5>&#13;
    <p>The avalanche problem is related to weakening of the snowpack due to the&#13;
      presence of liquid water. Water infiltrates the snowpack due to melt or&#13;
      rain.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Expected avalanche types</h5>&#13;
    <ul>
<li>Wet-snow slab avalanches</li>&#13;
      <li>Wet loose snow avalanches</li>&#13;
      <li>Mainly natural avalanches</li>&#13;
    </ul>
<h6>Where?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Spatial distribution</h5>&#13;
    <p>When sun is the main cause, distribution of the problem is mostly&#13;
      depending on aspect and elevation. All aspects are affected in the event&#13;
      of rain on snow.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Position of weak layers in the snowpack</h5>&#13;
    <p>Anywhere in the snowpack</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Why?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Release characteristics</h5>&#13;
    <p>Wet-snow slab avalanches:<br>&#13;
      Weakening of pre-existing weak layers in the snowpack or ponding at layer&#13;
      interfaces<br>&#13;
      If rain, there is also additional loading on weak layers <br>&#13;
      Wet loose snow avalanches:<br>&#13;
      Loss of cohesion between snow crystals</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>When?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Duration</h5>&#13;
    <p>Hours to days<br>&#13;
      Rapid loss of stability possible<br>&#13;
      Especially critical as water infiltrates for the first time deeper down,&#13;
      once the snowpack has warmed up to 0 °C.<br>&#13;
      Natural avalanches might be more likely at certain times of the day, in&#13;
      particular in the afternoon (unless rain is the dominating factor).</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>How to manage?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Identification of the problem in the field</h5>&#13;
    <p>The wet snow problem is usually easy to recognize. Onset of rain,&#13;
      snowballing, pin wheeling and small wet slabs or loose wet avalanches are&#13;
      often precursors of natural wet-snow slab avalanche activity. Deep&#13;
      foot-penetration is another sign of increased wetting.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Travel advice</h5>&#13;
    <p>In the presence of a sun crust the conditions after cold nights with clear&#13;
      skies are usually favourable in the morning due to freezing. After warm&#13;
      nights with overcast skies the problem often exists already in the&#13;
      morning. Normally rain on fresh snow creates this problem almost&#13;
      immediately. Good timing and trip planning are important. Consider&#13;
      avalanche runout zones.</p>&#13;

      <h2>Gliding snow</h2>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>What?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Characteristics</h5>&#13;
    <p>The entire snowpack is gliding on the ground, typically on smooth ground&#13;
      such as grassy slopes or smooth rock zones. High activity of glide-snow&#13;
      avalanches are typically related to a thick snowpack with no or only few&#13;
      layers. Glide snow avalanches can occur both with a cold dry snowpack and&#13;
      with a warm wet snowpack. The release of a glide-snow avalanche is&#13;
      difficult to predict, although glide cracks open usually before a release.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Expected avalanche types</h5>&#13;
    <ul>
<li>Glide snow avalanches; cold dry or 0°C-isothermal wet snowpack</li>&#13;
      <li>Any avalanche release is usually natural. Human and artificial&#13;
        triggering is unlikely.</li>&#13;
    </ul>
<h6>Where?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Spatial distribution</h5>&#13;
    <p>Predominant on smooth ground and on every aspect, but more often on&#13;
      south-facing slopes.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Position of weak layers in the snowpack</h5>&#13;
    <p>Interface between the ground and overlaying snowpack</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Why?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Release characteristics</h5>&#13;
    <p>Glide-snow avalanches are caused by a loss of friction at the snow-ground&#13;
      interface.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>When?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Duration</h5>&#13;
    <p>Days to months; possibly entire winter-season. The release can occur at&#13;
      any time during the day. In the spring, gliding avalanches occur mostly in&#13;
      the later part of the day.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>How to manage?</h6>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Identification of the problem in the field</h5>&#13;
    <p>With the presence of glide cracks the problem can often be localized,&#13;
      however, the presence of glide cracks does not indicate imminent avalanche&#13;
      release, as this is nearly impossible to predict. Avalanche release&#13;
      without pre-existing glide cracks is also common.</p>&#13;
    <h5 class="normal">Travel advice</h5>&#13;
    <p>Avoid areas close to glide cracks.</p>&#13;
