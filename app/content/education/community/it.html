&#13;
    <p>The avalanche warning services of Tyrol, South Tyrol, and Trentino are&#13;
      starting a research initiative to better understand how different types of&#13;
      backcountry users and decision-makers use their avalanche report products.&#13;
      A better understanding of usersâ€™ needs and challenges is critical for&#13;
      improving our existing products and developing new ones.</p>&#13;
    <p>While we are developing our report feedback survey, we are current looking&#13;
      for winter backcountry users (e.g., backcountry skiers/snowboarders, snow&#13;
      shoers, ice climbers, etc.) and community decision-makers (e.g. local&#13;
      avalanche commissions) interested in being part of a growing community&#13;
      that the avalanche warning services can consult to get feedback on their&#13;
      products and brainstorm about new opportunities.</p>&#13;
    <p>Please note that you do not have to be a long-term backcountry&#13;
      recreationists or avalanche expert to participate in our research. We are&#13;
      interested in the perspectives of everybody, particularly individuals who&#13;
      are just starting their backcountry adventures or only occasionally go&#13;
      into the backcountry.</p>&#13;
    <p>If you are interested in participating in this initiative, please click&#13;
      the 'Sign me up' button below to provide us with a bit of background&#13;
      information about yourself. We will contact you are soon as our first&#13;
      survey is ready.</p>&#13;
