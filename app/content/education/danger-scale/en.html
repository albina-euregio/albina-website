<h1>Danger Scale</h1>

<section class="section-centered">
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      The avalanche danger is evaluated on avalanche.report and communicates it
      with the five-levelled European avalanche danger scale. The five danger
      levels are described by three different parameters:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Probability of avalanche release</li>
      <li>Distribution of hazardous sites</li>
      <li>Size and frequency of expected avalanches</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The danger level always applies to a region with an area of >100 km&sup2;
      and not to a specific individual slope. The avalanche danger described on
      avalanche.report is always a forecast with uncertainties. It should always
      be checked on site.

    <h2>Background on the European avalanche danger scale</h2>

    <p>
      In 1993, the European Avalanche Warning Services agreed to introduce a
      uniform avalanche danger scale. The common scale defines the danger level
      based on snowpack stability and avalanche release probability. The
      complete description of the scale also contains additional, not
      internationally agreed columns on typical characteristics, recommendations
      and effects.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a
        href="https://www.avalanches.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/European_Avalanche_Danger_Scale-EAWS.pdf"
        >European Avalanche Danger Scale PDF</a
      >
    </p>

    <h6>
      The avalanche danger levels - a simplified representation of the complex
      processes in nature.
    </h6>

    <p>
      The European Avalanche Danger Scale is a five-level, ordinarily ascending,
      categorical scale. Ordinary ascending means that the scale has a ordinary
      ascending ranking. Categorical means that the scale consists of classes
      which - even if they are expressed with the numbers 1-5 - may not simply
      be processed mathematically. For example, the danger level 3-Considerable
      is not simply higher by one than danger level 2-Moderate, because the
      avalanche danger probably increases disproportionately (i.e. not
      linearly). In other words, danger level 3-Considerable is not one level
      higher than 2-Moderate, but probably twice as high. The danger levels must
      not be added either.
    </p>

    <h6>Definitions in the European avalanche danger scale</h6>

    <p>
      In the definition of the danger scale, the characteristics of the
      avalanche danger are defined for each level with the parameters
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Probability of avalanche release,</li>
      <li>Distribution of hazardous sites and</li>
      <li>Size and frequency of expected avalanches</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The changes or the combination of these input variables determine the
      avalanche danger level. Avalanche forecasters in Europe have agreed to use
      the EAWS matrix for a more harmonised determination of the danger levels.
      In order to do so, they take the three parameters probability of avalanche
      release, distribution of hazardous sites and size and frequency of the
      expected avalanches into account. In the case of 1-Low avalanche danger,
      for example, small avalanches should only be triggered in a few places and
      usually only with a high additional load, whereas in the case of avalanche
      danger 4-High many and sometimes also very large avalanches are likely to
      be triggered with to low additional loads (e.g. skiers) or may release
      spontaneously. The European avalanche danger level scale consists of five
      levels. In nature, however, the avalanche danger changes continuously and
      rises disproportionately.

      Figure 1: The natural course of avalanche danger (blue line) increases
      non-linearly. The categorical nature of the danger levels must therefore
      always reflect a range of natural avalanche danger conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore the avalanche danger can have very different characteristics
      within a danger level. This range is most apparent at hazard level
      3-Considerable. At the upper limit of this danger level many alarm signs
      are observed (whumphs, shooting cracks, fresh avalanches) and the danger
      is very present. At the lower limit of this danger level these clear
      indications are missing. Often - mostly unconsciously - this leads to
      riskier terrain choices.
    </p>

    <h6>Frequency of danger levels</h6>

    <p>
      In the assessment area of the avalanche.report, danger level 2-Moderate is
      forecast in almost half of the days (per warning region). This danger
      level is most frequently used. It thus describes a day with average
      avalanche danger. Level 3-Considerable is issued on about one third of the
      days. This is where most fatal accidents occur (approx. 50%). The danger
      level 4-High is issued on average only on 2% of winter days, i.e. on
      approx. 2-4 days per season. Level 5-Very high is reserved for castrophic
      situations and is therefore rarely used.
    </p>

    <h2>Various characteristics of avalanche danger</h2>

    <h6>Small, easy to trigger wind slabs</h6>

    <p>
      A single backcountry recreationist can often trigger fresh drifting-snow
      accumulations. The size of these so-called wind slabs depends not only on
      the wind, but also on the supply of fresh snow or a loosely bonded old
      snow surface. The size of the wind slabs depends on the amount of
      wind-drifted snow and the wind speed itself. In case only small amounts of
      snow can be transported, wind slabs remain rather small. If skier trigger
      these small wind slabs, avalanches tend to remain rather small.
      Consequently, deep burials are unlikely. Although release probability in
      this example may be quite high, forecaster assesses these conditions to a
      danger level 2-Moderate. With a certain amount of training accumulations
      with wind-drifted snow can usually be assessed fairly easy when good
      visibility prevails. In general, wind slabs should be avoided especially
      on terrain where slipping and falling may have fatal consequences.
    </p>

    <h6>Deep persistent weak layers</h6>

    <p>
      Deeply buried persistent weak layers (e.g. buried surface hoar, basal
      facets formed with cold on warm / warm on cold) are hard to trigger, since
      it is very difficult to initiate a fracture. Triggering of deep persistent
      weak layers may most likely occur where the snow is relatively shallow or
      at transitions from shallow to deep snow (see also shallow snow next to
      deep snow). In the case a persistent weak layer problem prevails with a
      prominent persistent weak layer deep down in the snowpack. Hazardous
      sites, where a single skier may initiate a fracture are relatively rare.
      However, in case of fracture initiation, avalanches may often become
      dangerously large for backcountry recreationists – with other words often
      fatal. Therefore, avalanche forecaster rate these situations often with
      avalanche danger 3-Considerable, even though locations for triggering an
      avalanche are rarely distributed. The situation is fairly complected to
      assess for backcountry recreationists since triggering locations are often
      very hard to detect, even with advanced skills and trained eye. The
      persistent weak layer problem produces more avalanche fatalities than any
      other typical avalanche problem.
    </p>

    <h6>4 - High with many skier-triggered avalanches</h6>

    <p>
      If numerous large and, in many cases, very large spontaneous avalanches
      are expected, the avalanche danger is rated with 4-High. Under such
      conditions, exposed locations (usually sections of transport routes, and
      in isolated cases also buildings) are at risk. In addition to this
      classical characteristics of avalanche danger level 4-High, there is a
      further variant where large avalanches are hardly expected (e.g. because
      there is still too little snow at the start of the winter) but a lot of
      medium and large avalanches are naturally released and/or can be triggered
      very easily at multiple locations. In this case, avalanche forecasters
      speak about a 'skier 4-High'. These situations represent a sever danger
      for backcountry recreationists, while transport routes remain unaffected
      or only affected in isolated cases.
    </p>

    <h6>Wet and glide-snow avalanche activity</h6>

    <p>
      Wet-snow avalanches are hardly triggered by skiers, while in the case of
      glide-snow avalanches this is virtually impossible. Therefore, natural
      triggering is the main cause of these avalanche types - even in the case
      of the lower danger levels. In fact, the definitions of the maximum
      possible spontaneous avalanche activity at the lower end of the avalanche
      danger scale relates mainly to wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches. In this
      context large spontaneous avalanches are possible when there is a
      2-Moderate avalanche danger for conditions causing wet-snow or glide-snow
      avalanches. In the case of a conditions causing dry-snow avalanches, such
      naturally triggered avalanche activity normally corresponds to a
      3-Considerable avalanche danger, as then avalanches are also expected to
      be triggered by individuals.
