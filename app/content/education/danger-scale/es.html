<section class="section-centered"><div class="panel">&#13;
    <p>The avalanche danger is evaluated on avalanche.report and communicates it&#13;
      with the five-levelled European avalanche danger scale. The five danger&#13;
      levels are described by three different parameters:</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <ul>
<li>Probabilidad de desencadenamiento de aludes</li>&#13;
      <li>Distribución de los lugares peligrosos</li>&#13;
      <li>Tamaño y frecuencia de aludes esperados</li>&#13;
    </ul>
<p>The danger level always applies to a region with an area of &gt;100 km&sup2;&#13;
      and not to a specific individual slope. The avalanche danger described on&#13;
      avalanche.report is always a forecast with uncertainties. It should always&#13;
      be checked on site.</p>&#13;

    <h2>Antecedentes de la escala de europea de peligro de aludes</h2>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>In 1993, the European Avalanche Warning Services agreed to introduce a&#13;
      uniform avalanche danger scale. The common scale defines the danger level&#13;
      based on snowpack stability and avalanche release probability. The&#13;
      complete description of the scale also contains additional, not&#13;
      internationally agreed columns on typical characteristics, recommendations&#13;
      and effects.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p><a href="https://www.avalanches.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/European_Avalanche_Danger_Scale-EAWS.pdf)">European Avalanche Danger Scale PDF</a></p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>The avalanche danger levels - a simplified representation of the complex&#13;
      processes in nature.</h6>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>The European Avalanche Danger Scale is a five-level, ordinarily ascending,&#13;
      categorical scale. Ordinary ascending means that the scale has a ordinary&#13;
      ascending ranking. Categorical means that the scale consists of classes&#13;
      which - even if they are expressed with the numbers 1-5 - may not simply&#13;
      be processed mathematically. For example, the danger level 3-Considerable&#13;
      is not simply higher by one than danger level 2-Moderate, because the&#13;
      avalanche danger probably increases disproportionately (i.e. not&#13;
      linearly). In other words, danger level 3-Considerable is not one level&#13;
      higher than 2-Moderate, but probably twice as high. The danger levels must&#13;
      not be added either.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Definiciones en la Escala europea de peligro de aludes</h6>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>In the definition of the danger scale, the characteristics of the&#13;
      avalanche danger are defined for each level with the parameters</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <ul>
<li>Probabilidad de desencadenamiento de aludes</li>&#13;
      <li>Distribución de zonas peligrosas y </li>&#13;
      <li>Tamaño y frecuencia de aludes esperados</li>&#13;
    </ul>
<p>The changes or the combination of these input variables determine the&#13;
      avalanche danger level. Avalanche forecasters in Europe have agreed to use&#13;
      the EAWS matrix for a more harmonised determination of the danger levels.&#13;
      In order to do so, they take the three parameters probability of avalanche&#13;
      release, distribution of hazardous sites and size and frequency of the&#13;
      expected avalanches into account. In the case of 1-Low avalanche danger,&#13;
      for example, small avalanches should only be triggered in a few places and&#13;
      usually only with a high additional load, whereas in the case of avalanche&#13;
      danger 4-High many and sometimes also very large avalanches are likely to&#13;
      be triggered with to low additional loads (e.g. skiers) or may release&#13;
      spontaneously. The European avalanche danger level scale consists of five&#13;
      levels. In nature, however, the avalanche danger changes continuously and&#13;
      rises disproportionately.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <table style="width: 100%;border: 0px solid #000;text-align: center"><tbody><tr>
<td><img style="align:middle;height:50%;width:50%" alt="Lawinengefahren" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="374a9b53-8018-40c7-9e8d-6ac15fa05968" src="/content_files/ava_danger_en.png"></td>&#13;
        </tr></tbody></table>
<p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 1: The natural course of avalanche danger (blue line) increases&#13;
      non-linearly. The categorical nature of the danger levels must therefore&#13;
      always reflect a range of natural avalanche danger conditions.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>Therefore the avalanche danger can have very different characteristics&#13;
      within a danger level. This range is most apparent at hazard level&#13;
      3-Considerable. At the upper limit of this danger level many alarm signs&#13;
      are observed (whumphs, shooting cracks, fresh avalanches) and the danger&#13;
      is very present. At the lower limit of this danger level these clear&#13;
      indications are missing. Often - mostly unconsciously - this leads to&#13;
      riskier terrain choices.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Frecuencia de los grados de peligro</h6>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>In the assessment area of the avalanche.report, danger level 2-Moderate is&#13;
      forecast in almost half of the days (per warning region). This danger&#13;
      level is most frequently used. It thus describes a day with average&#13;
      avalanche danger. Level 3-Considerable is issued on about one third of the&#13;
      days. This is where most fatal accidents occur (approx. 50%). The danger&#13;
      level 4-High is issued on average only on 2% of winter days, i.e. on&#13;
      approx. 2-4 days per season. Level 5-Very high is reserved for castrophic&#13;
      situations and is therefore rarely used.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h2>Diversas características del peligro de aludes</h2>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Pequeñas placas de viento fáciles de desencadenar</h6>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>A single backcountry recreationist can often trigger fresh drifting-snow&#13;
      accumulations. The size of these so-called wind slabs depends not only on&#13;
      the wind, but also on the supply of fresh snow or a loosely bonded old&#13;
      snow surface. The size of the wind slabs depends on the amount of&#13;
      wind-drifted snow and the wind speed itself. In case only small amounts of&#13;
      snow can be transported, wind slabs remain rather small. If skier trigger&#13;
      these small wind slabs, avalanches tend to remain rather small.&#13;
      Consequently, deep burials are unlikely. Although release probability in&#13;
      this example may be quite high, forecaster assesses these conditions to a&#13;
      danger level 2-Moderate. With a certain amount of training accumulations&#13;
      with wind-drifted snow can usually be assessed fairly easy when good&#13;
      visibility prevails. In general, wind slabs should be avoided especially&#13;
      on terrain where slipping and falling may have fatal consequences.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Capas débiles persistentes profundas</h6>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>Deeply buried persistent weak layers (e.g. buried surface hoar, basal&#13;
      facets formed with cold on warm / warm on cold) are hard to trigger, since&#13;
      it is very difficult to initiate a fracture. Triggering of deep persistent&#13;
      weak layers may most likely occur where the snow is relatively shallow or&#13;
      at transitions from shallow to deep snow (see also shallow snow next to&#13;
      deep snow). In the case a persistent weak layer problem prevails with a&#13;
      prominent persistent weak layer deep down in the snowpack. Hazardous&#13;
      sites, where a single skier may initiate a fracture are relatively rare.&#13;
      However, in case of fracture initiation, avalanches may often become&#13;
      dangerously large for backcountry recreationists – with other words often&#13;
      fatal. Therefore, avalanche forecaster rate these situations often with&#13;
      avalanche danger 3-Considerable, even though locations for triggering an&#13;
      avalanche are rarely distributed. The situation is fairly complected to&#13;
      assess for backcountry recreationists since triggering locations are often&#13;
      very hard to detect, even with advanced skills and trained eye. The&#13;
      persistent weak layer problem produces more avalanche fatalities than any&#13;
      other typical avalanche problem.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>4 - Fuerte con muchos aludes accidentales</h6>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>If numerous large and, in many cases, very large spontaneous avalanches&#13;
      are expected, the avalanche danger is rated with 4-High. Under such&#13;
      conditions, exposed locations (usually sections of transport routes, and&#13;
      in isolated cases also buildings) are at risk. In addition to this&#13;
      classical characteristics of avalanche danger level 4-High, there is a&#13;
      further variant where large avalanches are hardly expected (e.g. because&#13;
      there is still too little snow at the start of the winter) but a lot of&#13;
      medium and large avalanches are naturally released and/or can be triggered&#13;
      very easily at multiple locations. In this case, avalanche forecasters&#13;
      speak about a 'skier 4-High'. These situations represent a sever danger&#13;
      for backcountry recreationists, while transport routes remain unaffected&#13;
      or only affected in isolated cases.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Actividad de aludes de nieve húmeda y de deslizamientos</h6>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>Wet-snow avalanches are hardly triggered by skiers, while in the case of&#13;
      glide-snow avalanches this is virtually impossible. Therefore, natural&#13;
      triggering is the main cause of these avalanche types - even in the case&#13;
      of the lower danger levels. In fact, the definitions of the maximum&#13;
      possible spontaneous avalanche activity at the lower end of the avalanche&#13;
      danger scale relates mainly to wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches. In this&#13;
      context large spontaneous avalanches are possible when there is a&#13;
      2-Moderate avalanche danger for conditions causing wet-snow or glide-snow&#13;
      avalanches. In the case of a conditions causing dry-snow avalanches, such&#13;
      naturally triggered avalanche activity normally corresponds to a&#13;
      3-Considerable avalanche danger, as then avalanches are also expected to&#13;
      be triggered by individuals.</p>&#13;
