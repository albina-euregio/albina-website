      issued by the various warning services and is intended to exclude&#13;
      subjective influences as far as possible when forecasting avalanche&#13;

      the parameters distribution of hazardous sites, probability of avalanche&#13;
      release and the avalanche size and occurrence.</p>&#13;

    <h2>The EAWS matrix: A tool for an objective assessment of the avalanche&#13;
      danger level in Europe</h2>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>The EAWS Matrix is a tool introduced by the European Avalanche Warning&#13;
      Services for determining&#13;
      <a href="/education/danger-scale">avalanche danger levels </a> and is&#13;
      based on the definitions of the five-levelled avalanche danger level&#13;
      scale.</p>&#13;
    <p>The EAWS matrix covers the three important parameters within the&#13;
      definition of the European avalanche danger scale: the probability of&#13;
      avalanche release, the distribution of hazardous sites and avalanche size&#13;
      and occurrence. The EAWS Matrix can be divided into two parts: On the left&#13;
      part of the matrix, the avalanche danger level depends on the distribution&#13;
      of the hazardous sites, the additional load required for avalanche release&#13;
      and the size of the expected avalanches. On the right part, the danger&#13;
      levels are related to spontaneous avalanche activity. The combination&#13;
      leading to the highest danger level is decisive.</p>&#13;
    <p>The matrix on its y-axis describes the extent of the hazardous sites using&#13;
      the terms "isolated", "some", "many" or "many/most". It is also considered&#13;
      whether these spatially distributed hazardous sites can still be well&#13;
      indicates and communicated in the avalanche forecast, or whether the&#13;
      dangerous terrain may occur so frequently and diffusely that it can no&#13;
      longer be indicated.</p>&#13;
    <p>On the x-axis, the matrix describes the probability of avalanche release.&#13;
      The artificial and the spontaneous avalanche release is considered in two&#13;
      submatrices. The left matrix refers to the artificial release probability&#13;
      and describes it with the additional load and adverbs or verbs, which&#13;
      gives the probability a paraphrase. The classes range from "General only&#13;
      with high additional load", "especially with high additional load",&#13;
      "possible with low additional load" to "likely with low additional load".&#13;
      These terms express an increase in probability. Since it is not in the&#13;
      nature of man to be able to estimate probabilities well, the matrix tries&#13;
      to provide an estimate for these by means of these different descriptions.&#13;
      The right part of the matrix then describes the spontaneous, i.e. natural,&#13;
      avalanche release via the distribution, number and size of the avalanches&#13;
      to be expected.</p>&#13;
