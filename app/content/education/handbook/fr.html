    <h3 class="normal">Le bulletin du risque d'avalanche de la région européenne</h3>

    <p>Par le bulletin du risque d'avalanche de l'Euregio et divers produits auxiliaires, les trois Services de Prévision d’Avalanches du Tyrol, Tyrol du Sud et Trentin met des informations à la disposition du public sur les conditions de neige et d'avalanche dans cette région européenne. Les informations sont publiées en trois langues : l'allemand, l'italien et l'anglais.<br> Le bulletin d'avalanche de l'Euregio comporte une analyse à court terme du danger d'avalanche sous la forme d'un avertissement et des perspectives. Il est publié au moins une fois par jour pendant la saison hivernale. La communication la plus importante et la plus pertinente est une prévision du danger d'avalanche pour toutes les zones de cette région européenne, Tyrol, Tyrol du Sud et Trentin. Des données supplémentaires à l'évolution de la météo et à la structure du manteau neigeux fournissent une image plus précise et plus approfondie de la situation actuelle et de l'avenir, servant de base aux décisions individuelles. <br> Le bulletin du risque d'avalanche de l'Euregio est une prévision régionale du danger d'avalanche, donc il est soumis à des incertitudes, par exemple des variations et des divergences géographiques, ainsi que des facteurs temporels. Par conséquent, les informations contenues dans le bulletin d'avalanche de l'Euregio ne peuvent pas remplacer une évaluation locale indépendante sur place. En plus, en raison des données de base limitées, les informations sont trop générales pour fournir une analyse ponctuelle.<br> Le contenu et la conception du bulletin du risque d'avalanche de l'Euregio correspondent aux normes et directives actuelles <a href="https://www.avalanches.org/">des services européens de prévision du risque d’avalanche (EAWS)</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="normal">Groupe cible</h3>
    <p>The Euregio Avalanche Report is addressed to all people who are engaged in
      the mountains in wintertime, either professionally or for recreational
      purposes, and are exposed to avalanche danger; or to those who are
      responsible for the safety of others. This includes, among other things:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Local avalanche warning services and avalanche commissions of towns and
        roads, as well as safety authorities of mountain cable cars and lifts</li>
      <li>Members of ambulance and rescue services, police and military personnel</li>
      <li>Mountain guides, instructors of snow sports, tourist guides and
        directors</li>
      <li>Residents of mountain settlements</li>
      <li>Backcountry recreationists in unsecured terrain, e.g. freeriders,
        backcountry skiers, mountain climbers, ice climbers, snowshoe hikers</li>
    </ul>
<p>If a relatively favourable snow and avalanche situation prevails, the
      Euregio Avalanche Report serves particularly those persons who take part
      in winter sports in the mountains as a support for decisions to minimize
      their own risks. Starting at danger level 3 - considerable danger- the
      Euregio Avalanche Report contains an increased amount of information for
      local safety authorities and avalanche commissions. For danger level 5 -
      very high avalanche danger, when snow sports in backcountry terrain are
      hardly possible, the Euregio Avalanche Report by and large provides
      information for local safety authorities and avalanche commissions.</p>

    <h3 class="normal">Time of publication and of validity</h3>

    <p>During the months at the borders of winter, i.e. in early winter and late
      spring, as well as in the event of heavy snowfall in summertime, there is
      ordinarily a dearth of information available about snowpack layering and
      the prevailing avalanche situation. In this period, no danger level map is
      published. In such cases, the information is broadcast by the avalanche
      warning services of European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino by
      means of
      <a href="https://avalanche.report/blog?year=&amp;month=&amp;searchLang=&amp;region=all&amp;problem=all&amp;page=1&amp;searchText=">blog posts</a>. These contain details about the current and approaching developments of
      the snowpack situation as well as about avalanche danger, which easily may
      be valid for several days.</p>

    <p>In wintertime, the Euregio Avalanche Report is published at least once
      daily:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Edition 5:00 pm: assessment of avalanche danger for the following day,
        valid from 12:00 midnight until 12:00 midnight (in three languages).</li>
      <li>A coordinated update is possible at 8:00 am: forecast for that day,
        valid from 8:00 am until 12:00 midnight (in three languages).</li>
      <li>In principle, an assemssment of avalanche danger can also be published
        at other times. As a rule, however, this is done only rarely.</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Contenu &amp; Désign</h2>
      </div>
      <p>In wintertime, the information of the Euregio Avalanche Report is
        communicated through an interactive map. All contents are displayed
        according to the principle of the information pyramid (Figure 1). Thus,
        the avalanche danger level represents the most important information and
        is therefore listed first.</p>

      <div><img src="/content_files/pyramid_fr.png" title="information pyramid" alt="information pyramid"></div>

      <p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 1: The information pyramid leads the information flow in the
        Euregio Avalanche Report.</p>

      <p>Further information on the avalanche problems and their danger points,
        on the avalanche prone locations, on the description of the snowpack or
        on the tendency of the upcoming days, as well as weather information are
        only announced in the details.<br>
        In the following sections, the contents of the Euregio Avalanche Report
        are introduced, their design elucidated.</p>

      <h3 class="normal">Avalanche danger and danger level</h3>
      <p>The forecast of avalanche danger forms the most important part of the
        Euregio Avalanche Report. It comprises the following:</p>
      <ul>
<li>The danger level (optionally with elevations data)</li>
        <li>One to two current avalanche problems and their spatial distribution</li>
        <li>An assessment of the avalanche danger</li>
        <li>An analysis of the snowpack</li>
        <li>Tendency for the following 24 - 48 hours</li>
        <li>An internet link to the weather forecast</li>
      </ul>
<p>For assessing the avalanche danger level, the three Avalanche Warning
        Services of the European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino use the
        five-level European
        <a href="https://avalanche.report/education/danger-scale">avalanche danger scale</a>. Insofar as an overall danger analysis/description is possible, the
        regions will publish the same danger level, describe the same avalanche
        problems and point out the same particularly endangered aspects and
        elevations on a danger map (Figure 2). One overall area can be assigned
        two different danger levels with different elevation limits designated.</p>

      <p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 2: Overview of predominant danger levels in the European region
        Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino. Regions beyond the borders with the same
        avalanche danger situation are also included in the analysis. In case of
        anticipated daytime changes in the situation, these can also be
        analysed.</p>

      <p>In case of anticipated changes in danger level during the course of the
        day, two maps are used. This double map depicts the morning situation
        (usually the more favourable scenario) and the afternoon situation. The
        change in the danger levels is not strictly limited to 12:00 noon, but
        simply describes the ongoing change throughout the course of the day. A
        more precise analysis can also follow in the textual part of the Euregio
        Avalanche Report.</p>

      <h3 class="normal">Avalanche problem</h3>
      <p>An aggregate region can have maximum two typical
        <a href="https://avalanche.report/education/avalanche-problems">avalanche problems</a>
        assigned to it. The following five problems are possible:</p>
      <ul>
<li>Problème de la neige fraîche</li>
        <li>Problème de la neige soufflée</li>
        <li>Problème de couce fragile persistante</li>
        <li>Problème de la neige humide</li>
        <li>Problème de la neige glissante</li>
      </ul>
<p>Thanks to the simple and easily grasped pictograms, citing and
        pinpointing these problems enables report readers to form an intuitive
        and concise picture in their minds based on the Euregio Avalanche
        Report.</p>

      <h3 class="normal">Avalanche prone locations</h3>
      <p>An avalanche problem is usually allocated to a specific, particularly
        endangered spatial area, defined by elevation and aspect. The elevation
        limits of the problem generally coincide with the elevation limits of
        the danger level (Figure 3). If no particular avalanche problem
        predominates (often the case at danger level 1 - low) this information
        is omitted and a favourable avalanche situation is declared.
        <br>
        The avalanche prone locations where a given avalanche problem prevails
        are delineated by the aspect and the elevation limits. The blue-marked
        segments of a wind rose are indicators of those aspects. The elevation
        can be indicated by a specific borderline or border zone. Apart from
        that, the altitude above sea level generally follows as a written number
        or the term “treeline” accompanied by a visual depiction with arrows
        pointing in the appropriate direction.</p>

      <p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 3: Detailed overview of danger levels and avalanche problems
        including their corresponding danger zones (aspect and elevation)</p>

      <h3 class="normal">Assessment of avalanche danger</h3>
      <p>For each warning region on the map there is a specific assessment of
        avalanche danger in that region (Figure 4). This evaluation includes
        details about avalanche release probability, expected size of avalanches
        and extent of avalanche prone locations. When necessary, references,
        indications and recommendations for specific user groups are provided.
        <br>
        At the conclusion of the danger assessment, additional information might
        also be supplied to users, e.g. other possible sources of risk or a
        particularly unfavourable weather development.</p>

      <h3 class="normal">Manteau neigeux</h3>
      <p>For each warning region on the map there is an analysis of the snowpack
        (Figure 4). Snowpack structure is an important factor in the formation
        of avalanches. The analysis is general, as a rule comprising in the main
        the structure and the stability of the snow cover..</p>
      <p>The snowpack structure is defined by the layering of the snowpack and
        the structural characteristics of each individual layer, i.e. grain
        types, grain sizes, hardness. The snowpack stability tends to provide a
        measure of the likelihood of triggering. The snowpack layering by and
        large determines the stability of the snowpack.</p>
      <p>In this section, observed avalanches can be described.</p>

      <div><img src="/content_files/info2_en.png" title="snowpack" alt="snowpack"></div>

      <p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 4: Danger assessment and snowpack analysis are provided as a
        text. They form the lower part of the Information Pyramid. In addition,
        information about the predominant danger pattern and the immediate
        outlook is also provided.</p>

      <p>Above the detailed analysis of the snowpack, the appropriate
        <a href="https://avalanche.report/education/danger-patterns">danger patterns</a>
        are assigned to given avalanche problems. These can be seen as
        amplifications of the avalanche problems. They designate ten principal
        and recurring situations that frequently lead to avalanche accidents.</p>

      <h3 class="normal">Tendence</h3>
      <p>Based on the two-day forecast for the weather, the approximate tendency
        for the avalanche danger which includes the final day of validity of the
        report is estimated.</p>

      <h3 class="normal">Météo</h3>
      <p>For the forecasted weather conditions, we refer to the information
        provided by the Weather Services of the provinces Bolzano - South Tirol
        and Trentino and the forecasts supplied by the ZAMG Weather Service
        Innsbruck.</p>

      <h3 class="normal">Flexible warning regions</h3>
      <p>In order to clump regions together where the same danger level prevails,
        70 micro regions have been defined based on the snow/climatological
        conditions within the European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino.
        With these micro regions, large warning regions with the same assessed
        avalanche danger can be flexibly defined.</p>
      <p>With this purpose in mind, Tirol is divided into 29, South Tirol into 20
        and Trentino into 21 micro regions. These micro regions are defined by
        specific, accepted designations. They are depicted in Figure 5. Apart
        from the name, each micro region also has a code number assigned to it
        (see Table 1).</p>

        <p>The avalanche warning has a wide variety of data available to it for
          purposes of assessing avalanche danger (Figure 6). This information
          ranges from measurements, observations, on-site assessments all the
          way to the results of computer models. Only the final coalescence of
          all these data permits a reliable forecast of avalanche danger amid
          highly varied situations to be generated.</p>

        <p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 6: Data from weather stations and feedback from local and
          mobile observers, as well as private persons on the current avalanche
          situation provide the basis for the avalanche forecast. The Euregio
          Avalanche Report can be received via the Internet, email, mobile
          services, radio, TV and print media.</p>

        <h3 class="normal">Valeurs mesurées</h3>
        <p>In order to put together an avalanche report, the Avalanche Warning
          Services operate a vast network of automated
          <a href="/weather/stations">measurement stations</a>
          throughout the European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino. They
          boast the densest network of high alpine measurement stations in the
          world available for analysis. The measurements of the automated
          measuring stations are available to the general public, can be
          consulted via Internet in the form of tables and graphs under the menu
          <a href="https://avalanche.report/weather/map/fresh_snow">Snow &amp; Weather</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="normal">Observations and assessments</h3>
        <p>For a reliable assessment of avalanche danger, Avalanche Warning
          Services require current information from vast stretches of
          backcountry terrain. For that purpose, the three Avalanche Warning
          Services of the European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino also
          maintain their own network of observers. Depending on the given
          situation, highly diverse data is collected, e.g. estimates of new
          snow and snowdrift, observed alarm signs and already released
          avalanches, alongside personal assessments of current avalanche
          danger.</p>
        <p>Additional information is supplied by the avalanche commissions, local
          safety authorities, rescue organisations, police and, last but not
          least, backcountry recreationists. In this connection, reports on
          avalanches, which have occurred and were triggered by persons, and
          general avalanche activity are of particular importance. Important:
          Also avalanches in which persons were involved but not buried in snow
          or injured, need to be reported to the authorities as soon as possible
          after the avalanche released in order to prevent an unnecessary,
          expensive and labor-intensive rescue search. Furthermore, information
          about the current snow surface, e.g. graupel, surface hoar,
          rainfall/snowfall altitudes, etc., supply decisive clues about the
          extent to which the surface continues to threaten as a weak layer, and
          ultimately, could lead to a change in the danger level. These
          indicators are captured in the Euregio Avalanche Report, categorized
          and pinpointed geographically. The more details a given observation
          contains, the more it contributes to a correct assessment of avalanche
          danger in the Euregio Avalanche Report.</p>
        <p>The following parameters should be supplied under all circumstances,
          completely apart from any general assessment:</p>
        <ul>
<li>Location (if it cannot be specified, the nearest known fixed point)</li>
          <li>Altitude or altitude zone</li>
          <li>Aspect</li>
          <li>Slope gradient</li>
        </ul>
<p>Supplying the geographical coordinates and pictures makes possible a
          more precise assessment of avalanche danger, but this is not the
          uppermost priority.</p>

        <h3 class="normal">Stationary observers</h3>
        <p>Some of the observers of the Euregio Avalanche Report are stationary.
          They report avalanches or danger signs and frequently supply their
          personal assessment of the current avalanche danger. If possible they
          make a report every day throughout the winter, thereby assuring basic
          coverage and informational supply. These reports are made between 6:00
          and 8:00 am or at midday.</p>

        <h3 class="normal">Mobile observers</h3>
        <p>Some of the observers are completely mobile throughout the mountains
          of the European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino. They report
          whenever they have interesting or relevant information from wherever
          they happen to be. These reports can be sent to the Avalanche Warning
          Services via messenger services or emailed directly to the Avalanche
          Warning Services. In addition, selected mountain guides also make
          reports via mobile phone app NATLEFS and send us their standardized
          observations and assessments.<br>
          Because the European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino is so vast,
          and the regional differences so great, the official observers cannot
          ever capture the entire situation. For that reason, avalanche warnings
          are also dependent on the reports from private persons. We would like
          to extend a debt of thanks to all those who have assisted us with
          their observations and reports. At the same time, we would like to
          encourage them to continue giving us their personal impressions (for
          details, see Observations and assessments).</p>

        <h3 class="normal">Avalanche releases</h3>
        <p>Apart from avalanche releases, which were observed, avalanche
          accidents are also reported by the coordination centres and the rescue
          services. In addition, the Avalanche Warning Services also have
          available avalanche mapping from a variety of ski areas, as well as
          the data from automated avalanche detection systems. Reports about
          avalanche releases can also be made by private persons by registering
          them at the <a href="https://www.lawis.at/incident">LAWIS website</a>.</p>

            <h2>Possibilités et Limites du bulletin des risques d'avalanches de l'Euregio</h2>
          </div>
          <p>The Euregio Avalanche Report contains a forecast of avalanche
            danger. It lies in the nature of all forecasts that these are linked
            to many uncertainties and thus, could well prove unfounded. The
            Avalanche Warning Services of the European region Tirol – South
            Tirol – Trentino make every effort to make the contents and
            information provided in the avalanche forecast as complete and as
            correct as possible. However, they can assume no liability for the
            correctness or completeness of the contents and information
            supplied.</p>
          <p>Avalanche danger means danger to life and limb. The use of
            information provided by the Avalanche Warning Services of the
            European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino in no way absolves
            anyone from the personal responsibility of making one’s own personal
            assessment of the avalanche situation and behaving in ways
            concordant with that evaluation.</p>

          <h3 class="normal">Scope of application</h3>
          <p>In the Euregio Avalanche Report, only the conditions in backcountry
            terrain are described which lie within the European region Tirol –
            South Tirol – Trentino (Figure 5 and Table 1).</p>

          <h3 class="normal">Independent assessment</h3>
          <p>Evaluations in the Euregio Avalanche Report are general, that is to
            say, specific local conditions cannot be reflected in the forecasts,
            to say nothing of conditions on a specific mountain slope. The
            connection between regionally valid danger levels, possible
            avalanche activity and corresponding consequences, including
            measures to be taken, must be made by the users of the Euregio
            Avalanche Report through on-site evaluation. In this assessment, the
            backcountry recreationsists and safety authorities must apply their
            own experience and methods of evaluation as supportive aids.
            Included in this must be knowledge of local weather, snow and
            avalanche observations, snowpack analysis, studying maps, personal
            on-site judgment of a given mountain slope, alongside an
            individual’s own risk considerations. Safety authorities sometimes
            have the results of artificial avalanche triggerings available for
            their evaluations. In each individual decision, all available
            information should be taken into consideration. Information which
            lead to a conclusion that unstable conditions prevail should be
            given particular importance.</p>

          <h3 class="normal">Precision of data in avalanche forecasts</h3>
          <p>The forecasts in the Euregio Avalanche Report, similar to those in
            other warnings of natural disasters, e.g. heavy downpour,
            earthquakes, rockfalls, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, tsunamis,
            etc. are based on the laws of probability. In fact, due to our
            incomplete knowledge of all the geographic, spatial-spread and
            time-limit developments of the weather and, consequently, of the
            snowpack layering, a forecast of avalanche danger is by definition
            uncertain. Above and beyond that, the dangers which stem from
            avalanches can turn out to be highly diverse even within one
            indicated danger level.</p>
          <p>Disparities between the general forecast of the current avalanche
            situation on-site are also related to the geographic spread of the
            danger level (Figure 7) and its elevation limits.</p>

          <p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 7: Avalanche danger varies particularly at the borderlines of
            differently assessed warning regions, as illustrated in the above
            example along the borders of Tirol and South Tirol</p>

          <p>In the selfsame manner, information about location and spread of a
            given danger zone, namely, aspect and elevation, can also vary, as
            depicted in Figure 8. Divergences especially along borderlines of
            the warning regions require on-site evaluation, and personal conduct
            must be decided upon, corresponding to that assessment.</p>

          <p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 8: In reality, the allocated grade of prevalent danger, as
            well as the aspect and elevation of avalanche prone locations, can
            easily diverge from the information in the published avalanche
            forecast.</p>

          <p>Generally, there is less information available for high alpine
            regions than for low, intermediate and high altitudes. Consequently,
            all statements made about high alpine regions necessitate further
            evaluation and verification. Also when the weather situation is
            swiftly changing, particularly painstaking examination of the
            situation is necessary, since the Euregio Avalanche Report cannot
            reflect unpredictable geographic and time-related changes of
            avalanche danger as a rule.</p>

            <h3 class="normal">Interaktive Website</h3>
            <p>The interactive Euregio Avalanche Report can be consulted on the
              Internet. Because the website design is based on user input, it
              can be consulted not only on a desktop computer, but also on
              mobile pocket devices, e.g. smartphones, tablets, etc. The

              warning region in detail. By clicking on the appropriate warning
              region, an additional window opens with more precise altitude
              information of where the danger level applies as well as the
              prevalent avalanche problems there. By clicking on DETAILS, a more

              <br>
              During the winter season, the Avalanche Warning Services of the
              European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino ordinarily also
              publish additional details about the current snowpack layering,
              the resulting avalanche situation and the background of avalanches
              which have released, whether or not persons were involved,
              including infrastructure which might have been struck. These blogs
              serve to complement and round out the Euregio Avalanche Report.
              Nonetheless, they do not replace it.</p>
