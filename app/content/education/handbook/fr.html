&#13;
    <p>Through the Euregio Avalanche Report and a variety of ancillary products,&#13;
      the three avalanche warning services of Tirol, South Tirol and Trentino&#13;
      provide information to the public about the snow and avalanche conditions&#13;
      in this European region. The information is published in three languages:&#13;
      German, Italian and English.<br>&#13;
      The Euregio Avalanche Report includes a short-term analysis of avalanche&#13;
      danger and outlook. It takes the form of a warning. This is published at&#13;
      least once daily during the winter season. It contains a forecast of&#13;
      avalanche danger for all zones within this European region, Tirol, South&#13;
      Tirol, Trentino, as its most important and relevant communication.&#13;
      Additional data related to avalanche-relevant development of the weather&#13;
      and the structure of the snowpack provide a more precise and in-depth&#13;
      picture of the current and approaching situation, serving as a basis for&#13;
      individual assessments and decisions.<br>&#13;
      Since the Euregio Avalanche Report is a regional forecast of avalanche&#13;
      danger, it is subject to uncertainties, e.g. geographical variations and&#13;
      divergences, as well as time factors. For that reason, the information in&#13;
      the Euregio Avalanche Report cannot replace a local on-site evaluation.&#13;
      The information provided in the Euregio Avalanche Report is compiled from&#13;
      limited data and is too generalized to supply point-for-point analysis.&#13;
      <br>&#13;
      The contents and design of the Euregio Avalanche Report correspond to&#13;
      current standards and guidelines of the Association of&#13;
      <a href="https://www.avalanches.org/">European Avalanche Warning Services (EAWS)</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h3 class="normal">Public cible</h3>&#13;
    <p>The Euregio Avalanche Report is addressed to all people who are engaged in&#13;
      the mountains in wintertime, either professionally or for recreational&#13;
      purposes, and are exposed to avalanche danger; or to those who are&#13;
      responsible for the safety of others. This includes, among other things:</p>&#13;
    <ul>
<li>Local avalanche warning services and avalanche commissions of towns and&#13;
        roads, as well as safety authorities of mountain cable cars and lifts</li>&#13;
      <li>Les membres des services de secours, de la police et de l’armée</li>&#13;
      <li>Mountain guides, instructors of snow sports, tourist guides and&#13;
        directors</li>&#13;
      <li>Les habitants des villages de montagne</li>&#13;
      <li>Backcountry recreationists in unsecured terrain, e.g. freeriders,&#13;
        backcountry skiers, mountain climbers, ice climbers, snowshoe hikers</li>&#13;
    </ul>
<p>If a relatively favourable snow and avalanche situation prevails, the&#13;
      Euregio Avalanche Report serves particularly those persons who take part&#13;
      in winter sports in the mountains as a support for decisions to minimize&#13;
      their own risks. Starting at danger level 3 - considerable danger- the&#13;
      Euregio Avalanche Report contains an increased amount of information for&#13;
      local safety authorities and avalanche commissions. For danger level 5 -&#13;
      very high avalanche danger, when snow sports in backcountry terrain are&#13;
      hardly possible, the Euregio Avalanche Report by and large provides&#13;
      information for local safety authorities and avalanche commissions.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h3 class="normal">Date de publication et validité</h3>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>During the months at the borders of winter, i.e. in early winter and late&#13;
      spring, as well as in the event of heavy snowfall in summertime, there is&#13;
      ordinarily a dearth of information available about snowpack layering and&#13;
      the prevailing avalanche situation. In this period, no danger level map is&#13;
      published. In such cases, the information is broadcast by the avalanche&#13;
      warning services of European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino by&#13;
      means of&#13;
      <a href="https://avalanche.report/blog?year=&amp;month=&amp;searchLang=&amp;region=all&amp;problem=all&amp;page=1&amp;searchText=">blog posts</a>. These contain details about the current and approaching developments of&#13;
      the snowpack situation as well as about avalanche danger, which easily may&#13;
      be valid for several days.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>In wintertime, the Euregio Avalanche Report is published at least once&#13;
      daily:</p>&#13;
    <ul>
<li>Edition 5:00 pm: assessment of avalanche danger for the following day,&#13;
        valid from 12:00 midnight until 12:00 midnight (in three languages).</li>&#13;
      <li>A coordinated update is possible at 8:00 am: forecast for that day,&#13;
        valid from 8:00 am until 12:00 midnight (in three languages).</li>&#13;
      <li>In principle, an assemssment of avalanche danger can also be published&#13;
        at other times. As a rule, however, this is done only rarely.</li>&#13;
    </ul>

        <h2>Contenu &amp; Désign</h2>&#13;
      </div>&#13;
      <p>In wintertime, the information of the Euregio Avalanche Report is&#13;
        communicated through an interactive map. All contents are displayed&#13;
        according to the principle of the information pyramid (Figure 1). Thus,&#13;
        the avalanche danger level represents the most important information and&#13;
        is therefore listed first.</p>&#13;
&#13;

      <p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 1: The information pyramid leads the information flow in the&#13;
        Euregio Avalanche Report.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Further information on the avalanche problems and their danger points,&#13;
        on the avalanche prone locations, on the description of the snowpack or&#13;
        on the tendency of the upcoming days, as well as weather information are&#13;
        only announced in the details.<br>&#13;
        In the following sections, the contents of the Euregio Avalanche Report&#13;
        are introduced, their design elucidated.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <h3 class="normal">Danger d’avalanches et degré de danger</h3>&#13;
      <p>The forecast of avalanche danger forms the most important part of the&#13;
        Euregio Avalanche Report. It comprises the following:</p>&#13;
      <ul>
<li>Degré de danger (en option avec hauteur)</li>&#13;
        <li>Une ou deux situations avalancheuses typiques et leurs endroits dangereux</li>&#13;
        <li>Une description des dangers</li>&#13;
        <li>Une analyse du manteau neigeux</li>&#13;
        <li>La tendance pour les 24 - 48 heures suivantes</li>&#13;
        <li>Un lien vers la météo</li>&#13;
      </ul>
<p>For assessing the avalanche danger level, the three Avalanche Warning&#13;
        Services of the European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino use the&#13;
        five-level European&#13;
        <a href="https://avalanche.report/education/danger-scale">avalanche danger scale</a>. Insofar as an overall danger analysis/description is possible, the&#13;
        regions will publish the same danger level, describe the same avalanche&#13;
        problems and point out the same particularly endangered aspects and&#13;
        elevations on a danger map (Figure 2). One overall area can be assigned&#13;
        two different danger levels with different elevation limits designated.</p>&#13;

      <p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 2: Overview of predominant danger levels in the European region&#13;
        Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino. Regions beyond the borders with the same&#13;
        avalanche danger situation are also included in the analysis. In case of&#13;
        anticipated daytime changes in the situation, these can also be&#13;
        analysed.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>In case of anticipated changes in danger level during the course of the&#13;
        day, two maps are used. This double map depicts the morning situation&#13;
        (usually the more favourable scenario) and the afternoon situation. The&#13;
        change in the danger levels is not strictly limited to 12:00 noon, but&#13;
        simply describes the ongoing change throughout the course of the day. A&#13;
        more precise analysis can also follow in the textual part of the Euregio&#13;
        Avalanche Report.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <h3 class="normal">Situation avalancheuse typique</h3>&#13;
      <p>An aggregate region can have maximum two typical&#13;
        <a href="https://avalanche.report/education/avalanche-problems">avalanche problems</a>&#13;
        assigned to it. The following five problems are possible:</p>&#13;
      <ul>
<li>Situation de la neige fraîche</li>&#13;
        <li>Situation de la neige soufflée (neige ventée)</li>&#13;
        <li>Situation de la neige ancienne (sous-couche fragile persistante)</li>&#13;
        <li>Situation des avalanches mouillées (neige humide)</li>&#13;
        <li>Situation des avalanches de glissement (avalanches de fond)</li>&#13;
      </ul>
<p>Thanks to the simple and easily grasped pictograms, citing and&#13;
        pinpointing these problems enables report readers to form an intuitive&#13;
        and concise picture in their minds based on the Euregio Avalanche&#13;
        Report.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <h3 class="normal">Endroits dangereux</h3>&#13;
      <p>An avalanche problem is usually allocated to a specific, particularly&#13;
        endangered spatial area, defined by elevation and aspect. The elevation&#13;
        limits of the problem generally coincide with the elevation limits of&#13;
        the danger level (Figure 3). If no particular avalanche problem&#13;
        predominates (often the case at danger level 1 - low) this information&#13;
        is omitted and a favourable avalanche situation is declared.&#13;
        <br>&#13;
        The avalanche prone locations where a given avalanche problem prevails&#13;
        are delineated by the aspect and the elevation limits. The blue-marked&#13;
        segments of a wind rose are indicators of those aspects. The elevation&#13;
        can be indicated by a specific borderline or border zone. Apart from&#13;
        that, the altitude above sea level generally follows as a written number&#13;
        or the term “treeline” accompanied by a visual depiction with arrows&#13;
        pointing in the appropriate direction.</p>&#13;

        including their corresponding danger zones (aspect and elevation)</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <h3 class="normal">Évaluation du danger d'avalanche</h3>&#13;
      <p>For each warning region on the map there is a specific assessment of&#13;
        avalanche danger in that region (Figure 4). This evaluation includes&#13;
        details about avalanche release probability, expected size of avalanches&#13;
        and extent of avalanche prone locations. When necessary, references,&#13;
        indications and recommendations for specific user groups are provided.&#13;
        <br>&#13;
        At the conclusion of the danger assessment, additional information might&#13;
        also be supplied to users, e.g. other possible sources of risk or a&#13;
        particularly unfavourable weather development.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <h3 class="normal">Manteau neigeux</h3>&#13;
      <p>For each warning region on the map there is an analysis of the snowpack&#13;
        (Figure 4). Snowpack structure is an important factor in the formation&#13;
        of avalanches. The analysis is general, as a rule comprising in the main&#13;
        the structure and the stability of the snow cover..</p>&#13;
      <p>The snowpack structure is defined by the layering of the snowpack and&#13;
        the structural characteristics of each individual layer, i.e. grain&#13;
        types, grain sizes, hardness. The snowpack stability tends to provide a&#13;
        measure of the likelihood of triggering. The snowpack layering by and&#13;
        large determines the stability of the snowpack.</p>&#13;
      <p>Cette section peut également inclureles avalanches observées.</p>&#13;

&#13;
      <p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 4: Danger assessment and snowpack analysis are provided as a&#13;
        text. They form the lower part of the Information Pyramid. In addition,&#13;
        information about the predominant danger pattern and the immediate&#13;
        outlook is also provided.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Above the detailed analysis of the snowpack, the appropriate&#13;
        <a href="https://avalanche.report/education/danger-patterns">danger patterns</a>&#13;
        are assigned to given avalanche problems. These can be seen as&#13;
        amplifications of the avalanche problems. They designate ten principal&#13;
        and recurring situations that frequently lead to avalanche accidents.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <h3 class="normal">Tendence</h3>&#13;
      <p>Based on the two-day forecast for the weather, the approximate tendency&#13;
        for the avalanche danger which includes the final day of validity of the&#13;
        report is estimated.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <h3 class="normal">Météo</h3>&#13;
      <p>For the forecasted weather conditions, we refer to the information&#13;
        provided by the Weather Services of the provinces Bolzano - South Tirol&#13;
        and Trentino and the forecasts supplied by the ZAMG Weather Service&#13;
        Innsbruck.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <h3 class="normal"> Régions de prévision flexible</h3>&#13;
      <p>In order to clump regions together where the same danger level prevails,&#13;
        70 micro regions have been defined based on the snow/climatological&#13;
        conditions within the European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino.&#13;
        With these micro regions, large warning regions with the same assessed&#13;
        avalanche danger can be flexibly defined.</p>&#13;
      <p>With this purpose in mind, Tirol is divided into 29, South Tirol into 20&#13;
        and Trentino into 21 micro regions. These micro regions are defined by&#13;
        specific, accepted designations. They are depicted in Figure 5. Apart&#13;
        from the name, each micro region also has a code number assigned to it&#13;
        (see Table 1).</p>&#13;

          mobile observers, as well as private persons on the current avalanche&#13;
          situation provide the basis for the avalanche forecast. The Euregio&#13;

&#13;
        <h3 class="normal">Valeurs mesurées</h3>&#13;
        <p>In order to put together an avalanche report, the Avalanche Warning&#13;
          Services operate a vast network of automated&#13;
          <a href="/weather/stations">measurement stations</a>&#13;
          throughout the European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino. They&#13;
          boast the densest network of high alpine measurement stations in the&#13;
          world available for analysis. The measurements of the automated&#13;
          measuring stations are available to the general public, can be&#13;
          consulted via Internet in the form of tables and graphs under the menu&#13;
          <a href="https://avalanche.report/weather/map/fresh_snow">Snow &amp; Weather</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <h3 class="normal">Observations et Évaluations</h3>&#13;
        <p>For a reliable assessment of avalanche danger, Avalanche Warning&#13;
          Services require current information from vast stretches of&#13;
          backcountry terrain. For that purpose, the three Avalanche Warning&#13;
          Services of the European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino also&#13;
          maintain their own network of observers. Depending on the given&#13;
          situation, highly diverse data is collected, e.g. estimates of new&#13;
          snow and snowdrift, observed alarm signs and already released&#13;
          avalanches, alongside personal assessments of current avalanche&#13;
          danger.</p>&#13;
        <p>Additional information is supplied by the avalanche commissions, local&#13;
          safety authorities, rescue organisations, police and, last but not&#13;
          least, backcountry recreationists. In this connection, reports on&#13;
          avalanches, which have occurred and were triggered by persons, and&#13;
          general avalanche activity are of particular importance. Important:&#13;
          Also avalanches in which persons were involved but not buried in snow&#13;
          or injured, need to be reported to the authorities as soon as possible&#13;
          after the avalanche released in order to prevent an unnecessary,&#13;
          expensive and labor-intensive rescue search. Furthermore, information&#13;
          about the current snow surface, e.g. graupel, surface hoar,&#13;
          rainfall/snowfall altitudes, etc., supply decisive clues about the&#13;
          extent to which the surface continues to threaten as a weak layer, and&#13;
          ultimately, could lead to a change in the danger level. These&#13;
          indicators are captured in the Euregio Avalanche Report, categorized&#13;
          and pinpointed geographically. The more details a given observation&#13;
          contains, the more it contributes to a correct assessment of avalanche&#13;
          danger in the Euregio Avalanche Report.</p>&#13;
        <p>The following parameters should be supplied under all circumstances,&#13;
          completely apart from any general assessment:</p>&#13;
        <ul>
<li>Lieu (s'il ne peut être précisé, le point fixe connu le plus proche)</li>&#13;
          <li>Altitude ou zone d'altitude</li>&#13;
          <li>Exposition</li>&#13;
          <li>Pente</li>&#13;
        </ul>
<p>Supplying the geographical coordinates and pictures makes possible a&#13;
          more precise assessment of avalanche danger, but this is not the&#13;
          uppermost priority.</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <h3 class="normal">Observateurs fixes</h3>&#13;
        <p>Some of the observers of the Euregio Avalanche Report are stationary.&#13;
          They report avalanches or danger signs and frequently supply their&#13;
          personal assessment of the current avalanche danger. If possible they&#13;
          make a report every day throughout the winter, thereby assuring basic&#13;
          coverage and informational supply. These reports are made between 6:00&#13;
          and 8:00 am or at midday.</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <h3 class="normal">Observateurs mobiles</h3>&#13;
        <p>Some of the observers are completely mobile throughout the mountains&#13;
          of the European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino. They report&#13;
          whenever they have interesting or relevant information from wherever&#13;
          they happen to be. These reports can be sent to the Avalanche Warning&#13;
          Services via messenger services or emailed directly to the Avalanche&#13;
          Warning Services. In addition, selected mountain guides also make&#13;
          reports via mobile phone app NATLEFS and send us their standardized&#13;
          observations and assessments.<br>&#13;
          Because the European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino is so vast,&#13;
          and the regional differences so great, the official observers cannot&#13;
          ever capture the entire situation. For that reason, avalanche warnings&#13;
          are also dependent on the reports from private persons. We would like&#13;
          to extend a debt of thanks to all those who have assisted us with&#13;
          their observations and reports. At the same time, we would like to&#13;
          encourage them to continue giving us their personal impressions (for&#13;
          details, see Observations and assessments).</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <h3 class="normal">Déclenchements des avalanches</h3>&#13;
        <p>Apart from avalanche releases, which were observed, avalanche&#13;
          accidents are also reported by the coordination centres and the rescue&#13;
          services. In addition, the Avalanche Warning Services also have&#13;
          available avalanche mapping from a variety of ski areas, as well as&#13;
          the data from automated avalanche detection systems. Reports about&#13;
          avalanche releases can also be made by private persons by registering&#13;
          them at the <a href="https://www.lawis.at/incident">LAWIS website</a>.</p>&#13;

          </div>&#13;
          <p>The Euregio Avalanche Report contains a forecast of avalanche&#13;
            danger. It lies in the nature of all forecasts that these are linked&#13;
            to many uncertainties and thus, could well prove unfounded. The&#13;
            Avalanche Warning Services of the European region Tirol – South&#13;
            Tirol – Trentino make every effort to make the contents and&#13;
            information provided in the avalanche forecast as complete and as&#13;
            correct as possible. However, they can assume no liability for the&#13;
            correctness or completeness of the contents and information&#13;
            supplied.</p>&#13;
          <p>Avalanche danger means danger to life and limb. The use of&#13;
            information provided by the Avalanche Warning Services of the&#13;
            European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino in no way absolves&#13;
            anyone from the personal responsibility of making one’s own personal&#13;
            assessment of the avalanche situation and behaving in ways&#13;
            concordant with that evaluation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
          <h3 class="normal">Domaine d'application</h3>&#13;
          <p>In the Euregio Avalanche Report, only the conditions in backcountry&#13;
            terrain are described which lie within the European region Tirol –&#13;
            South Tirol – Trentino (Figure 5 and Table 1).</p>&#13;
&#13;
          <h3 class="normal">Évaluation indépendante</h3>&#13;
          <p>Evaluations in the Euregio Avalanche Report are general, that is to&#13;
            say, specific local conditions cannot be reflected in the forecasts,&#13;
            to say nothing of conditions on a specific mountain slope. The&#13;
            connection between regionally valid danger levels, possible&#13;
            avalanche activity and corresponding consequences, including&#13;
            measures to be taken, must be made by the users of the Euregio&#13;
            Avalanche Report through on-site evaluation. In this assessment, the&#13;
            backcountry recreationsists and safety authorities must apply their&#13;
            own experience and methods of evaluation as supportive aids.&#13;
            Included in this must be knowledge of local weather, snow and&#13;
            avalanche observations, snowpack analysis, studying maps, personal&#13;
            on-site judgment of a given mountain slope, alongside an&#13;
            individual’s own risk considerations. Safety authorities sometimes&#13;
            have the results of artificial avalanche triggerings available for&#13;
            their evaluations. In each individual decision, all available&#13;
            information should be taken into consideration. Information which&#13;
            lead to a conclusion that unstable conditions prevail should be&#13;
            given particular importance.</p>&#13;
&#13;
          <h3 class="normal">Précision des données dans la prévision des avalanches</h3>&#13;
          <p>The forecasts in the Euregio Avalanche Report, similar to those in&#13;
            other warnings of natural disasters, e.g. heavy downpour,&#13;
            earthquakes, rockfalls, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, tsunamis,&#13;
            etc. are based on the laws of probability. In fact, due to our&#13;
            incomplete knowledge of all the geographic, spatial-spread and&#13;
            time-limit developments of the weather and, consequently, of the&#13;
            snowpack layering, a forecast of avalanche danger is by definition&#13;
            uncertain. Above and beyond that, the dangers which stem from&#13;
            avalanches can turn out to be highly diverse even within one&#13;
            indicated danger level.</p>&#13;
          <p>Disparities between the general forecast of the current avalanche&#13;
            situation on-site are also related to the geographic spread of the&#13;
            danger level (Figure 7) and its elevation limits.</p>&#13;

          <p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 7: Avalanche danger varies particularly at the borderlines of&#13;
            differently assessed warning regions, as illustrated in the above&#13;
            example along the borders of Tirol and South Tirol</p>&#13;
&#13;
          <p>In the selfsame manner, information about location and spread of a&#13;
            given danger zone, namely, aspect and elevation, can also vary, as&#13;
            depicted in Figure 8. Divergences especially along borderlines of&#13;
            the warning regions require on-site evaluation, and personal conduct&#13;
            must be decided upon, corresponding to that assessment.</p>&#13;

          <p class="small" style="text-align:center">Figure 8: In reality, the allocated grade of prevalent danger, as&#13;
            well as the aspect and elevation of avalanche prone locations, can&#13;
            easily diverge from the information in the published avalanche&#13;
            forecast.</p>&#13;
&#13;
          <p>Generally, there is less information available for high alpine&#13;
            regions than for low, intermediate and high altitudes. Consequently,&#13;
            all statements made about high alpine regions necessitate further&#13;
            evaluation and verification. Also when the weather situation is&#13;
            swiftly changing, particularly painstaking examination of the&#13;
            situation is necessary, since the Euregio Avalanche Report cannot&#13;
            reflect unpredictable geographic and time-related changes of&#13;
            avalanche danger as a rule.</p>&#13;

            <p>In winter the Euregio Avalanche Report consists of an interactive&#13;
              map, which is published daily. In off-season no danger map is&#13;
              published in the Euregio Avalanche Report. In off-season,&#13;
              avalanche danger and snowpack situation is described in our&#13;
              <a href="https://avalanche.report/blog?year=&amp;month=&amp;searchLang=&amp;region=all&amp;problem=all&amp;page=1&amp;searchText=">blog</a>.</p>&#13;
            <p>The Euregio Avalanche Report and the internal contents of our&#13;
              website are published in three languages. They are available to&#13;
              readers in German, Italian and English.</p>&#13;
&#13;
            <h3 class="normal">Site web interactif</h3>&#13;
            <p>The interactive Euregio Avalanche Report can be consulted on the&#13;
              Internet. Because the website design is based on user input, it&#13;
              can be consulted not only on a desktop computer, but also on&#13;
              mobile pocket devices, e.g. smartphones, tablets, etc. The&#13;
              depictions which appear are, of course, adapted to the device&#13;
              being used.</p>&#13;
            <p>For further information regarding assessment of avalanche danger&#13;
              within a particular micro region, the user zooms in or fans out&#13;
              over the&#13;
              <a href="https://avalanche.report/bulletin/latest">interactive danger map</a>. Moving the mouse over the map brings forth the composite&#13;
              warning region in detail. By clicking on the appropriate warning&#13;
              region, an additional window opens with more precise altitude&#13;
              information of where the danger level applies as well as the&#13;
              prevalent avalanche problems there. By clicking on DETAILS, a more&#13;
              precise elucidation of the avalanche danger, e.g. the aspects and&#13;
              altitude where the specified avalanche problems prevail, danger&#13;
              assessment, snowpack description and outlook appear in textual&#13;
              form.</p>&#13;

            <h3 class="normal">Version imprimée</h3>&#13;
            <p>Parallel to the Euregio Avalanche Report in the Internet, there is&#13;
              also a printed version available as a PDF file. This version,&#13;
              including possible updates, is published at the same time as the&#13;
              online Euregio Avalanche Report. Its contents are identical to it.&#13;
              <br>&#13;
              In order for the PDF file be downloaded and printed, the PDF&#13;
              button must be clicked. Then the entire European region can be&#13;
              selected or merely Tirol or South Tirol or Trentino selected. In&#13;
              addition, downloading can be activated in colour or in&#13;
              black/white.</p>&#13;

              of the Euregio Avalanche Report can be consulted at the website.&#13;
              Outside the regular times of publication (for details, see Times&#13;
              of publication and of validity) this also contains all pertinent&#13;
              information relating to the avalanche situation.&#13;
              <br>&#13;
              During the winter season, the Avalanche Warning Services of the&#13;
              European region Tirol – South Tirol – Trentino ordinarily also&#13;
              publish additional details about the current snowpack layering,&#13;
              the resulting avalanche situation and the background of avalanches&#13;
              which have released, whether or not persons were involved,&#13;
              including infrastructure which might have been struck. These blogs&#13;
              serve to complement and round out the Euregio Avalanche Report.&#13;
              Nonetheless, they do not replace it.</p>&#13;

              also be sent directly from the app.</p>&#13;
&#13;
            <h3 class="normal">Radio</h3>&#13;
            <p>Tirol: Daily at 5:00 pm, a speaking memo is made available to a&#13;
              variety of media in which the avalanche danger of the following&#13;
              day is described.</p>&#13;
            <p>South Tirol: Every Friday afternoon, a speaking memo is generated&#13;
              which is made available to all South Tyrolean radio stations and&#13;
              describes the avalanche situation for the weekend. Due to the&#13;
              limited validity, it can only be sent and/or received between&#13;
              Friday at 4:30 pm and Saturday at 10:00 am.</p>&#13;
            <p>Trentino: For the province of Trentino, there is currently no&#13;
              comparable service available.</p>&#13;
&#13;
            <h3 class="normal">Presse</h3>&#13;
            <p>South Tirol: In the daily newspaper Dolomiten, a short forecast of&#13;
              the danger level is published daily, with indications of details&#13;
              to be found in the Internet.</p>&#13;
            <p>Tirol and Trentino: Currently in neither of these European regions&#13;
              are there regular reports of avalanche danger published in the&#13;
              print media, unless avalanche danger is heightened.</p>&#13;
&#13;
            <h3 class="normal">Télévision</h3>&#13;
            <p>In the regional news broadcasts Tirol heute and Südtirol heute&#13;
              (ORF2), the avalanche situation is broadcast shortly after the&#13;
              respective state/provincial news. This occurs irregularly, most&#13;
              frequently on Fridays, sporadically also on other days,&#13;
              particularly when avalanche danger is heightened.</p>&#13;
