  "about:introduction": "Passionate backcountry recreationists from Tirol, South Tyrol and Trentino are discovering more and more tours throughout the so-called Euregio. In order to guarantee maximum safety, avalanche warning services from the three states/provinces Tirol, South Tyrol and Trentino have joined forces to publish a joint, multilingual and cross-border avalanche forecast for the 2018-2019 winter season. In addition, there will also be maps of snow and new snow height, air temperature and wind.",
  "about:idea:headline": "The idea: a common project",
  "about:idea:text": "For some time now there has been the idea of bringing the avalanche warning services of the so-called Euregio region closer together. Since January 2017 the Interreg project ALBINA Euregio-Avalanche Bulletin on the Interreg project Italia-Austria was approved and work on this project started.<br />The project's main goal is the realization of a joint multilingual avalanche forecast designed to daily inform citizens about the avalanche situation in the entire Euregio territory. In order to achieve this, the project aims at standardizing the work of the avalanche forecasters through a unified workflow based on EAWS standards for the preparation of the avalanche forecast while organizing apposite periodic training. Communication structures developed within the project will promote and facilitate the exchange of information among experts of the three territories, thanks to a software system that will display the weather station data, observations, snow profiles and avalanche activity of the whole region and will enable publishing of the common avalanche forecast.<br />The exchange of information will occur through standardized interfaces and formats that will facilitate future extensions and connections. The Euregio avalanche forecast will be presented on a website in an intuitive and uniform way thanks to optimized mapping and descriptions based on predefined text blocks. Standardized interfaces with the media and social networks will facilitate the broadcast of the forecast. All data will be freely accessible thus supporting the Open Data initiative. This first cross-border avalanche forecast is a decisive step forward in risk prevention and management in the Euregio territory.",
