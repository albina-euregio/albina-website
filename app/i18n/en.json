  "about:introduction": "Passionate backcountry recreationists from Tirol, South Tyrol and Trentino are discovering more and more tours throughout the so-called Euregio. In order to guarantee maximum safety, avalanche warning services from the three states/provinces Tirol, South Tyrol and Trentino have joined forces to publish a joint, multilingual and cross-border avalanche forecast for the 2018-2019 winter season. In addition, there will also be maps of snow and new snow height, air temperature and wind.",
  "about:idea:headline": "The idea: a common project",
  "about:idea:text": "For some time now there has been the idea of bringing the avalanche warning services of the so-called Euregio region closer together. Since January 2017 the Interreg project ALBINA Euregio-Avalanche Bulletin on the Interreg project Italia-Austria was approved and work on this project started.<br />The project's main goal is the realization of a joint multilingual avalanche forecast designed to daily inform citizens about the avalanche situation in the entire Euregio territory. In order to achieve this, the project aims at standardizing the work of the avalanche forecasters through a unified workflow based on EAWS standards for the preparation of the avalanche forecast while organizing apposite periodic training. Communication structures developed within the project will promote and facilitate the exchange of information among experts of the three territories, thanks to a software system that will display the weather station data, observations, snow profiles and avalanche activity of the whole region and will enable publishing of the common avalanche forecast.<br />The exchange of information will occur through standardized interfaces and formats that will facilitate future extensions and connections. The Euregio avalanche forecast will be presented on a website in an intuitive and uniform way thanks to optimized mapping and descriptions based on predefined text blocks. Standardized interfaces with the media and social networks will facilitate the broadcast of the forecast. All data will be freely accessible thus supporting the Open Data initiative. This first cross-border avalanche forecast is a decisive step forward in risk prevention and management in the Euregio territory.",

The EAWS Matrix is based on the definitions of the five-levelled avalanche danger scale valid throughout Europe. The EAWS Matrix serves to standardize the avalanche danger level assessed and issued by the various warning services and is intended to exclude subjective influences as far as possible when forecasting avalanche danger.

  "education:eaws-matrix:text:2": "The EAWS matrix covers the three important parameters within the definition of the European avalanche danger scale: the probability of avalanche release, the distribution of hazardous sites and avalanche size and occurrence. The EAWS Matrix can be divided into two parts: On the left part of the matrix, the avalanche danger level depends on the distribution of the hazardous sites, the additional load required for avalanche release and the size of the expected avalanches. On the right part, the danger levels are related to spontaneous avalanche activity. The combination leading to the highest danger level is decisive.",
  "education:eaws-matrix:text:3": "The matrix on its y-axis describes the extent of the hazardous sites using the terms \"isolated\", \"some\", \"many\" or \"many/most\". It is also considered whether these spatially distributed hazardous sites can still be well indicates and communicated in the avalanche forecast, or whether the dangerous terrain may occur so frequently and diffusely that it can no longer be indicated.",
  "education:eaws-matrix:text:4": "On the x-axis, the matrix describes the probability of avalanche release. The artificial and the spontaneous avalanche release is considered in two submatrices. The left matrix refers to the artificial release probability and describes it with the additional load and adverbs or verbs, which gives the probability a paraphrase. The classes range from \"General only with high additional load\", \"especially with high additional load\", \"possible with low additional load\" to \"likely with low additional load\". These terms express an increase in probability. Since it is not in the nature of man to be able to estimate probabilities well, the matrix tries to provide an estimate for these by means of these different descriptions. The right part of the matrix then describes the spontaneous, i.e. natural, avalanche release via the distribution, number and size of the avalanches to be expected.",

  "education:avalanche-problems:introduction": "In the every day life we recognize people who we have already met before. The recognition happens in a few seconds, without any long thoughts and usually is correct. For persons we have memorized and know well can, this process of recognition works with less detailled characteristics, e.g. silhouette, gait or voice. In other words, we are made for pattern recognition. In fact, we can also use this ability to recognize similar situations when making decisions in avalanche terrain. The five typical avalanche problems were defined with this goal in mind. They describe typical situations, how they occur in the terrain and how they can support both avalanche forecasters and backcountry recreationists in their assessment of the avalanche danger. They supplement the description of the danger level and the hazardous terrain (aspect and elevation) and represent the third part of the information pyramid. The following definitions contain a description of the problem including the expected avalanche types, the spatial distribution and the position of the weak layers within the snow cover. In addition, the trigger mechanisms, typical duration of the danger and final advice on how to travel in avalanche terrain are discussed. The main focus here is on backcountry recreationists who move in avalanche terrain. In addition, the description of avalanche problems can also be helpful for local authorities (e.g. avalanche commissions).",

For example, the danger level 3-Considerable is not simply higher by one than danger level 2-Moderate, because the avalanche danger probably increases disproportionately (i.e. not linearly).

In the case of 1-Low avalanche danger, for example, small avalanches should only be triggered in a few places and usually only with a high additional load, whereas in the case of avalanche danger 4-High many and sometimes also very large avalanches are likely to be triggered with to low additional loads (e.g. skiers) or may release spontaneously.

The size of these so-called wind slabs depends not only on the wind, but also on the supply of fresh snow or a loosely bonded old snow surface. The size of the wind slabs depends on the amount of wind-drifted snow and the wind speed itself. In case only small amounts of snow can be transported, wind slabs remain rather small. If skier trigger these small wind slabs, avalanches tend to remain rather small. Consequently, deep burials are unlikely. Although release probability in this example may be quite high, forecaster assesses these conditions to a danger level 2-Moderate. With a certain amount of training accumulations with wind-drifted snow can usually be assessed fairly easy when good visibility prevails. In general, wind slabs should be avoided especially on terrain where slipping and falling may have fatal consequences.",

Triggering of deep persistent weak layers may most likely occur where the snow is relatively shallow or at transitions from shallow to deep snow (see also shallow snow next to deep snow). In the case a persistent weak layer problem prevails with a prominent persistent weak layer deep down in the snowpack. Hazardous sites, where a single skier may initiate a fracture are relatively rare. However, in case of fracture initiation, avalanches may often become dangerously large for backcountry recreationists – with other words often fatal. Therefore, avalanche forecaster rate these situations often with avalanche danger 3-Considerable, even though locations for triggering an avalanche are rarely distributed. The situation is fairly complected to assess for backcountry recreationists since triggering locations are often very hard to detect, even with advanced skills and trained eye.

In this context large spontaneous avalanches are possible when there is a 2-Moderate avalanche danger for conditions causing wet-snow or glide-snow avalanches.

This is because in autumn after the first big snowfalls, a lengthy period of stable, highpressure weather or at least precipitation-free weather frequently follows. That is when ideal conditions prevail for the partial metamorphism of snow into loose crystals, which then form a deep persistent weak layer for subsequent snowfall to be deposited on. During the course of early winter, this can occur in a wide range of altitudes and aspects. In general, deep persistent weak layers formed in early winter are triggered by skiers and freeriders at the beginning of the season, but it is also possible later on in winters with little snowfall.

A glide crack points to the possibility of a glide-snow avalanche without giving any indication if or when such a glide-snow avalanche will actually release. Regarding their timing, glide-snow avalanches number among the most difficult avalanches of all to predict, since they can trigger literally at any time of day or night, even when the snow situation is at its most stable.

The problem is that fresh snowdrifts are deposited on wind-protected leeward slopes on top of a loose old snow cover surface which usually contains depth hoar.

Wind influences both snow which is falling and snow which has already been deposited. It is a major factor in the formation of avalanches. When the snow is loose and dry, wind transports it, thereby increasing avalanche danger. The colder the transported snow, the more sensitively it reacts to additional loading, because it is so brittle. It is characteristic of this danger pattern that the weak layer usually consists of new snow and is buried by snowdrifts. Thus, there must have been snowfall at low temperatures without wind impact either just before or in a previous period when the drifting began; or else the snowfall set in without wind influence, but winds arose during the snowfall. This is a pattern which ordinarily can be recognized with ease and lasts only for a short time. The exception is a situation in which the old snowpack surface consisting of loose, faceted crystals is itself transported by wind.

  "education:danger-patterns:dp9:text": "A weak layer inside a snowpack is often compared with ball bearings. This image is actually suitable only for graupel: a spherical, granular form of precipitation which is often deposited during showers such as thunderstorms during springtime. It is easy to grasp that snowdrifts accumulating atop of a layer of graupel can only be poorly bonded with it, so that the danger of avalanches increases. Graupel is frequently spread over very small surface areas. Without examining the snowpack itself it is difficult to spot, even for professionals. This is an extremely treacherous phenomenon. Fortunately, the problems it creates are short-lived.",

  "education:danger-patterns:dp10:text": "Springtime presents a particularly delicate challenge to backcountry skiers and boarders, as well as to members of avalanche commissions. Rarely do states of “safe” and “unsafe” lie quite so near in time to each other. Thus, the span of danger levels, which occur within the course of one single day is wide ranging. On the one hand, avalanche danger is never easier to evaluate than in stable corn-snow conditions; on the other, avalanches of such magnitude as in springtime are rarely registered in deep winter. Apart from the snowpack layering, the complex interaction of air temperature, air moisture, solar radiation and wind play a major role. For backcountry skiers and boarders, high discipline in timing and flexibility of route planning are more essential than ever.",

It takes the form of a warning. This is published at least once daily during the winter season. It contains a forecast of avalanche danger for all zones within this European region, Tirol, South Tirol, Trentino, as its most important and relevant communication. Additional data related to avalanche-relevant development of the weather and the structure of the snowpack provide a more precise and in-depth picture of the current and approaching situation, serving as a basis for individual assessments and decisions.<br />Since the Euregio Avalanche Report is a regional forecast of avalanche danger, it is subject to uncertainties, e.g. geographical variations and divergences, as well as time factors. For that reason, the information in the Euregio Avalanche Report cannot replace a local on-site evaluation. The information provided in the Euregio Avalanche Report is compiled from limited data and is too generalized to supply point-for-point analysis.<br />The contents and design of the Euregio Avalanche Report correspond to current standards and guidelines of the Association of <a href=\"https://www.avalanches.org/\">European Avalanche Warning Services (EAWS)</a>.</p>",
