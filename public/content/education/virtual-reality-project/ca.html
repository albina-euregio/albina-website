    <p>The simulation begins for the users in their virtual home: First, they&#13;
      have to pack all the necessary items for a tour in the mountains -&#13;
      including an avalanche transceiver, shovel and probe - into their&#13;
      backpack. Once this is done, the ascent to the alpine area follows. After&#13;
      the avalanche transceiver check and emergency briefing, the mountain tour&#13;
      is started, during which an avalanche is assumed to have occurred. In the&#13;
      simulation, a buried person has to be located. To do this, various&#13;
      techniques such as avalanche transceiver search and point location/probing&#13;
      have to be used. The scenario finally ends with the shovelling out and the&#13;
      arrival of the professional rescue forces.</p>&#13;
