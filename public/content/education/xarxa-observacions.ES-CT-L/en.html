    <h2>FLOC community</h2>
    <p>
      FLOC is a snow and avalanche observation app available for Android and iOS, created by the Atesmaps Association. It is a
      collaborative project in which users create the information through the observations they make when they go to the
      mountains during winter. The goal of this tool is to share knowledge among users and create a database of current
      conditions that is useful for activity planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app allows 5 types of geolocated observations that can include images. It works both online and offline. If there is
      no coverage, the geolocated information can be entered and it will be uploaded automatically to the server once coverage
      is available.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The 5 forms available in the app are:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quick observation:</strong> basic in nature, detailing the type of mountain activity carried out, the weather and snow conditions found, and the observed signs of instability.</li>
      <li><strong>Meteorological observation:</strong> includes information on sky conditions, type and intensity of precipitation, temperature, wind, and the amount of new snow accumulated in the last 24 hours, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Avalanche observation:</strong> records the characteristics and location of one or more avalanches.</li>
      <li><strong>Snowpack observation:</strong> describes the observed snowpack (aspect, elevation, surface snow type, etc.) with the option to detail stability test results.</li>
      <li><strong>Accident observation:</strong> allows you to report directly to the ACNA accident committee and feed the accident database.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since the 2025/2026 season, the Centre de Lauegi encourages the collective use of this application to collect snow and
      avalanche data in Aranese territory and surrounding areas (a 10 km radius from the boundaries of Val d'Aran). This
      information is useful for producing avalanche danger bulletins, is available on this website's observation map, and also
      promotes community education in this field. The data can also be consulted through the app itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to collect as much information as possible on the conditions and stability of the snowpack in Val d'Aran
      throughout the winter, we encourage you to join the FLOC community!

    <h2>ObsLauegi community</h2>
    <p>
      ObsLauegi is an informal network for exchanging observations of avalanches, snow conditions, and weather in Val d'Aran and
      surrounding areas. It is made up of professionals and recreational snow users who actively share their observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary channel where observations are recorded and sent is the FLOC app. For more complex and delicate information
      that cannot be transmitted via FLOC, or for complementary information to FLOC observations, there is a WhatsApp group. The
      Centre de Lauegi shares analyses, profiles, blog posts, events, and information from other relevant places in this group.
      It is a channel where questions can be asked and debate can be generated for the benefit of all participants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this <a href="https://forms.gle/a5dGFqwnwv8kVCyw6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FORM</a> you can submit your
      request to join the group, provided you commit to following the established participation code.

    <h2>Nivometeorological stations</h2>
    <p>
      The Conselh Generau d'Aran has 3 full mountain stations (Comalada at 2070 m, Cap del Port at 2250 m, and Colomèrs at 2550 m),
      to which 3 more mountain stations are added (Sasseuva at 2228 m, Bonaigua at 2266 m, and Estanh Redon at 2247 m) and one
      valley station (Vielha-Elipòrt at 1027 m) from the Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya. There is also the Cap de Vaquèira
      station at 2447 m from the State Meteorological Agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      These stations record data in real time and continuously throughout the year and generally have the following equipment:
      rain gauge, anemometer, solar radiation sensor, hygrometer, thermometer, snow depth sensor, and snow temperature sensor.
      All of this data is public and can be consulted on the Centre de Lauegi website and on the Meteocat website (only its own).
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel, data from the Comalada, Sasseuva, and Colomèrs stations are used to run the Snowpack model and obtain snowpack
      simulations on flat terrain and on the 4 virtual aspects (N, E, S, and W) both in nowcast (from measured station data) and
      in forecast (from meteorological model data for the station locations).
