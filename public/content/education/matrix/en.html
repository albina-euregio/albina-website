      The EAWS Matrix is a tool introduced by the European Avalanche Warning
      Services with to goal of helping avalanche forecasters in determining the
      <a href="/education/danger-scale">avalanche danger levels </a> in a more
      objective way. The EAWS Matrix is based on the definitions of the
      five-levelled avalanche danger scale valid throughout Europe. The EAWS
      Matrix serves to standardize the avalanche danger level assessed and
      issued by the various warning services and is intended to exclude
      subjective influences as far as possible when forecasting avalanche
      danger. The avalanche forecaster determine the avalanche danger level via
      the parameters distribution of hazardous sites, probability of avalanche
      release and the avalanche size and occurrence.

      The EAWS matrix: A tool for an objective assessment of the avalanche
      danger level in Europe
    </h2>

    <p>
      The EAWS Matrix is a tool introduced by the European Avalanche Warning
      Services for determining
      <a href="/education/danger-scale">avalanche danger levels </a> and is
      based on the definitions of the five-levelled avalanche danger level
      scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The EAWS matrix covers the three important parameters within the
      definition of the European avalanche danger scale: the probability of
      avalanche release, the distribution of hazardous sites and avalanche size
      and occurrence. The EAWS Matrix can be divided into two parts: On the left
      part of the matrix, the avalanche danger level depends on the distribution
      of the hazardous sites, the additional load required for avalanche release
      and the size of the expected avalanches. On the right part, the danger
      levels are related to spontaneous avalanche activity. The combination
      leading to the highest danger level is decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matrix on its y-axis describes the extent of the hazardous sites using
      the terms "isolated", "some", "many" or "many/most". It is also considered
      whether these spatially distributed hazardous sites can still be well
      indicates and communicated in the avalanche forecast, or whether the
      dangerous terrain may occur so frequently and diffusely that it can no
      longer be indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the x-axis, the matrix describes the probability of avalanche release.
      The artificial and the spontaneous avalanche release is considered in two
      submatrices. The left matrix refers to the artificial release probability
      and describes it with the additional load and adverbs or verbs, which
      gives the probability a paraphrase. The classes range from "General only
      with high additional load", "especially with high additional load",
      "possible with low additional load" to "likely with low additional load".
      These terms express an increase in probability. Since it is not in the
      nature of man to be able to estimate probabilities well, the matrix tries
      to provide an estimate for these by means of these different descriptions.
      The right part of the matrix then describes the spontaneous, i.e. natural,
      avalanche release via the distribution, number and size of the avalanches
      to be expected.
