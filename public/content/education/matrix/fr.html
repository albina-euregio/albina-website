    <h2>The EAWS Matrix: A tool for an objective assessment of the avalanche
      danger level in Europe</h2>

    <p>The EAWS Matrix is used to determine
      <a href="/education/danger-scale">avalanche danger levels </a> based on
      snowpack stability, frequency of snowpack stability and
      <a href="/education/avalanche-sizes">avalanche size</a>.</p>
    <p>The EAWS Matrix is a substantial part of the decisional workflow for
      avalanche forecasters in Europe. The forecaster approaches the EAWS Matrix
      with the following thoughts: In a first step she assess snowpack stability
      by picking one of the classes very poor, poor, or fair and concurrently
      the frequency of the given class with lowest snowpack stability (many,
      some, or few) that decribes the
      <a href="/education/avalanche-problems">avalanche problem</a> best. In a
      second step the forecaster assesses how large the largest expected
      avalanche can become and chooses the corresponding field within the
      selected snowpack stability and frequency chart. For a more detailed
      description of the assessment process go and check the European workflow
      on avalanche danger assessment.</p>
    <p>The given avalanche danger levels of the current EAWS Matrix was obtained
      by a survey of numerous forecasters in Europe. They were asked to assess a
      danger level for the various combinations of snowpack stability, frequency
      of snowpack stability and avalanche size. Figure 1 shows that some fields
      within the EAWS Matrix contain two proposed danger levels. The median
      danger level is indicated showing the integer value for each danger level
      (e.g., 1 for <i>1-Low</i>). If the distribution of responses by the
      forecasters was rather heterogeneous, a second value is given in brackets,
      representing the interquartile range, if this value was different from the
      median danger level. When applying the EAWS Matrix (Figure 1), the
      forecaster should use the first danger level given in the cell. An
      optional danger level in parenthesis indicates that forecasters might
      disagree and a tendency towards a second danger level. These cells should
      be considered carefully and collected feedback on for future evaluation.
      For example, if the forecaster assessed that the dominant avalanche
      problem is best described by the factors <i>poor</i> snow stability on
      <i>manny</i> slopes and avalanches up to <i>size 3</i> are expected, the
      result would be avalanche danger level <i>4-High</i>.</p>
