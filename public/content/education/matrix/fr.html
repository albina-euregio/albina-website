    <p>The EAWS Matrix is a tool introduced by the European Avalanche Warning&#13;
      Services with to goal of helping avalanche forecasters in determining the&#13;
      <a href="/education/danger-scale">avalanche danger levels </a> in a more&#13;
      objective way. The EAWS Matrix serves to standardize the avalanche danger level assessed and&#13;
      issued by the various warning services and is intended to exclude&#13;
      subjective influences as far as possible when forecasting avalanche&#13;
      danger.</p>&#13;

    <h2>The EAWS Matrix: A tool for an objective assessment of the avalanche&#13;
      danger level in Europe</h2>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>The EAWS Matrix is used to determine <a href="/education/danger-scale">avalanche danger levels </a> &#13;
      based on snowpack stability, frequency of snowpack stability and <a href="/education/avalanche-sizes">avalanche size</a>.</p>&#13;
    <p>The EAWS Matrix is a substitial part of the decisional workflow for avalanche &#13;
      forecasters in Europe. The forecaster approaches the EAWS Matrix with the following thoughts: In a first&#13;
      step she assess snowpack stability by picking one of the classes very poor, poor, or fair and &#13;
      concurrently the frequency of the given class with lowest snowpack stability &#13;
      (many, some, or few) that decribes the <a href="/education/avalanche-problems">avalanche problem</a> best. &#13;
      In a second step the forecaster assesses how large the largest expected avalanche &#13;
      can become and chooses the corresponding field within the selected snowpack stability and &#13;
      frequency chart. For a more detailed description of the assessment process go and check &#13;
      the Eureopean workflow on avalanche danger assessment.</p>&#13;
    <p>The given avalanche danger levels of the current EAWS Matrix was obtained by a survey &#13;
      of numerous forecasters in Europe. They were asked to assess a danger level for the various &#13;
      combinations of snowpack stability, frequency of snowpack stability and avalanche size. &#13;
      Figure 1 shows that some fields within the EAWS Matrix contain two proposed danger levels. &#13;
      The median danger level is indicated showing the integer value for each danger level &#13;
      (e.g., 1 for <i>1-Low</i>). If the distribution of responses by the forecasters was rather heterogeneous, &#13;
      a second value is given in brackets, representing the interquartile range, if this value was &#13;
      different from the median danger level. When applying the EAWS Matrix (Figure 1), the forecaster &#13;
      should use the first danger level given in the cell. An optional danger level in parenthesis indicates &#13;
      that forecasters might disagree and a tendency towards a second danger level. These cells should be &#13;
      considered carefully and collected feedback on for future evaluation. For example, if the forecaster &#13;
      assessed that the dominant avalanche problem is best described by the factors <i>poor</i> snow stability &#13;
      on <i>manny</i> slopes and avalanches up to <i>size 3</i> are expected, the result would be &#13;
      avalanche danger level <i>4-High</i>.</p>&#13;
