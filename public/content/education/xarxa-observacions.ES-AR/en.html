      FLOC is a snow and avalanche observation app available for Android and iOS, created by the Atesmaps Association. It is a
      collaborative project in which users create the information through the observations they make when they go to the
      mountains during winter. The goal of this tool is to share knowledge among users and create a database of current
      conditions that is useful for activity planning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app allows 5 types of geolocated observations that can include images. It works both online and offline. If there is
      no coverage, the geolocated information can be entered and it will be uploaded automatically to the server once coverage
      is available.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The 5 forms available in the app are:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quick observation:</strong> basic in nature, detailing the type of mountain activity carried out, the weather and snow conditions found, and the observed signs of instability.</li>
      <li><strong>Meteorological observation:</strong> includes information on sky conditions, type and intensity of precipitation, temperature, wind, and the amount of new snow accumulated in the last 24 hours, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Avalanche observation:</strong> records the characteristics and location of one or more avalanches.</li>
      <li><strong>Snowpack observation:</strong> describes the observed snowpack (aspect, elevation, surface snow type, etc.) with the option to detail stability test results.</li>
      <li><strong>Accident observation:</strong> allows you to report directly to the ACNA accident committee and feed the accident database.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Since the 2025/2026 season, the Centre de Lauegi encourages the collective use of this application to collect snow and
      avalanche data in Aranese territory and surrounding areas (a 10 km radius from the boundaries of Val d'Aran). This
      information is useful for producing avalanche danger bulletins, is available on this website's observation map, and also
      promotes community education in this field. The data can also be consulted through the app itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to collect as much information as possible on the conditions and stability of the snowpack in Val d'Aran
      throughout the winter, we encourage you to join the FLOC community!
