<h1>Setting the spatial & temporal scale</h1>

<section class="section-centered">
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      The following spatial scales must be considered when determining the avalanche danger level for a region.
    </p>

    <h2>Forecasting domain</h2>
    <p>
      Forecasting domain is the area of responsibility of an avalanche warning service issuing public 
      avalanche forecasts. The forecasting domain is generally static for a service/operation. In the case of 
      the warning services within the Euregio the static domain is represented by the bounds of the Euregio, 
      i.e. the area of Tirol, South Tyrol and Trentino.
    </p>

    <h2>Micro-regions</h2>
    <p>
      Micro-regions are the smallest, geographically clearly specified areas used for avalanche danger 
      assessment. They are agian static. Furthermore, they permit the forecast user to know exactly which 
      region is described. They may be delineated by administrative boundaries (e.g., between 
      countries, federal states, or regions and provinces); describe climatologically, hydrologically, 
      or meteorologically homogeneous regions; or may be based on orographic divisions, or a combination of 
      these <a href="https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/18/2697/2018/">(Techel et al., 2018)</a>. For more 
      details on the micro-regions defined within the Euregio please go and check our <a href="education/handbook"
      >Handbook</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Reference unit</h2>

    <p>
      A reference unit is the smallest spatial-temporal entity at which an avalanche danger level can be 
      assessed. A reference unit can be delineated by different elevations and/or aspects within a 
      micro-region (Figure 1). It must still be large enough to include a variety of avalanche terrain, 
      thus that issuing an avalanche danger level makes sense. The reference unit needs to be defined and 
      remains consistent within a forecasting service (and ideally across forecasting services).
    </p>

    <h2>Warning region</h2>
    <p>
      A warning region is an aggregation of micro-regions, where avalanche conditions are considered similar 
      and are assessed with the same danger level, critical aspects, and elevations where the danger and the 
      avalanche problems prevail, and danger description. The way they are aggregated can vary from day to 
      day. A warning region is smaller or equal to the forecasting domain and larger or equal to a micro-region.
    </p>

    <h2>Resolution</h2>
    
    <p>
      The spatial-temporal resolution used to assess avalanche danger depends primarily on the availability of 
      relevant and reliable data in a sufficient spatial density and temporal frequency. Therefore, the 
      resolution of avalanche danger assessment will vary between warning services. Typically, the following 
      elements characterize the spatial-temporal resolution used to determine the avalanche danger level:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>the size of the micro-regions within a forecasting domain (Figure 1a),</li>
      <li>the resolution of elevation and/or aspect (Figure 1b and c), and</li>
      <li>the temporal subdivision within the valid period of a forecast 
        (e.g., in the morning/evening, Figure 1d).</li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      The resolution of these elements defines the lowest spatial and temporal units at which a 
      forecaster can issue an avalanche danger level, which we refer to as reference unit. The warning services 
      within the Euregio use the following set of spatial and temporal entities to assess avalanche danger:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>At least one micro-region</li>
      <li>At maximum two elevation bands</li>
      <li>At least 1/8 of all possible aspects, but in general 1/3</li>
      <li>At maximum two time steps (e.g. morning / afternoon)</li>
    </ul>

      Figure 1: Figure 1: Elements typically chosen to determin the reference unit.
    </p>

  <p>
    Figure 1 shows how a reference unit typically can be characterized by the combination of the 
    smallest subdivisions for the elements: (a) the smallest geographical entity (the micro-region) 
    within a forecasting domain, (b) the resolution of elevation and (c) aspect, and (d) a temporal 
    subdivision. In the figure, exemplary sub-divisions are highlighted. Here, the size of a single micro 
    region defines the spatial extent, elevation is resolved in 200 m increments, but is assessed as above 
    (and below) an elevation threshold, the aspect is split into eight parts, while the temporal 
    subdivision allows a distinction between morning and afternoon. The combination of the elements 
    highlighted blue, would be the reference unit, the smallest spatial-temporal entity at which the 
    avalanche danger level can be assessed.
