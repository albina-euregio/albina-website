<p>Snowpack stability, along with the <a href="/education/frequency">frequency distribution of snowpack stability</a> and &#13;
  <a href="/education/avalanche-sizes">avalanche size</a>, is one of the key contributors &#13;
  when assessing the <a href="/education/danger-scale">avalanche danger level</a> using the &#13;
  <a href="/education/matrix">EAWS Matrix</a>.&#13;
  Since the EAWS General Assemby in Davos in June 2022, all three variables were defined and underpinned &#13;
  with examples used in practice. Definitons, remarks, examples and more in-depth information for the variable &#13;
  snowpack stability can be found in the following sections or on <a href="www.avalananches.org/standards/">avalanches.org</a></p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Definition</h6>&#13;
    <p>Snowpack stability is a local property of the snowpack describing the propensity &#13;
      of a snow-covered slope to avalanche <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL078069">(Reuter and Schweizer, 2018)</a>. &#13;
      Snowpack stability is described using four classes: <i>Very Poor</i>, <i>Poor</i>, <i>Fair</i>, &#13;
      and <i>Good</i>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Remarks</h6>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>Depending on the avalanche type, snowpack stability is described by:</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <ul>
<li>Failure initiation, crack propagation and slab tensile support &#13;
        (snow-slab avalanche) <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GL078069">(Reuter and Schweizer, 2018)</a>
</li>&#13;
      <li>Loss of strength/bonding (loose-snow avalanche) (e.g. McClung and Schaerer, 2006)</li>&#13;
      <li>Loss of basal friction and slab tensile and/or compressive support (glide-snow avalanche) &#13;
        <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL052479">(e.g. Bartelt et al., 2012)</a>
</li>&#13;
    </ul>
<p>Snowpack stability is inversely related to the probability of avalanche release. &#13;
      Snowpack stability describes the snowpack to fail given a specific &#13;
      trigger <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11069-017-3070-5">(Statham et al., 2018)</a>, &#13;
      as for instance a person skiing a slope. &#13;
      Table 1 shows the relation between snowpack stability and how easy it is to trigger an avalanche.</p>&#13;

    <p>The term local refers to a point which ranges in size from &#13;
      a potential trigger location or stability test to a starting zone.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>All snowpack stability assessments may refer to either future (forecast) or present (nowcast) &#13;
      based on observations or models. For instance, if the snowpack in a release area is considered &#13;
      <i>Fair</i> today, and until tomorrow a layer of new snow is expected, the stability of &#13;
      tomorrows snowpack including the new snow layer needs to be assessed. Likely, it has changed &#13;
      to <i>Poor</i> or even <i>Very Poor</i> by that time.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Relation between the snowpack stability classes and typical phenomena or observations</h6>&#13;
    &#13;
    <p>Figures 1 to 3 provide an overview of the relation between the snowpack stability classes &#13;
      and typical phenomena or observations dependent on three major avalanche release types.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>Figure 1 shows examples for common evidence or indications for snowpack stability classes focusing on &#13;
      dry-snow slab avalanches release. &#13;
      Most prominent examples are spontaneous avalanches, signs of instability or classical &#13;
      snowpack stability tests, such as the Extended Column Test (ECT) or the Rutschblock Test (RB). &#13;
      Arrows indicate that existence towards lower stability classes is imperative. Natural avalanches are &#13;
      a clear indication for the class <i>Very Poor</i>, while a low and a high additional load are considered &#13;
      approximately equivalent to <i>Poor</i> and <i>Fair</i> snowpack stability. Observations and stability test&#13;
      results should be regarded as indicative only.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>Abbreviations within the Figure: Extended Column Test (ECT), &#13;
      Rutschblock (RB), whole block (wB), partial release (pR). &#13;

&#13;
    <p>For wet-snow stability and glide-snow stability, the separation between the classes <i>Fair</i> and &#13;
      <i>Poor</i> is often difficult. &#13;
      Wet-snow avalanches most often release naturally and are therefore connected to the class <i>Very Poor</i>. &#13;
      Observations will often only provide a tendency towards either <i>Good</i> or <i>Very Poor</i> stability &#13;
      (Figures 2 and 3). Stability tests generally work poorly in wet snow. If they indicate <i>Very Poor</i> &#13;
      stability, they should still be considered, but not otherwise.</p>&#13;
