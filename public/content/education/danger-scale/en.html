<h1>Danger Scale</h1>

<section class="section-centered">
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      The avalanche danger is evaluated on avalanche.report and communicates it
      with the five-levelled European avalanche danger scale. The five danger
      levels are described by three different parameters:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Probability of avalanche release</li>
      <li>Distribution of hazardous sites</li>
      <li>Size and frequency of expected avalanches</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The danger level always applies to a region with an area of
      >100&nbsp;km&sup2; and not to a specific individual slope. The avalanche
      danger described on avalanche.report is always a forecast with
      uncertainties. It should always be checked on site.

    <h2>Background on the European avalanche danger scale</h2>

    <p>
      In 1993, the European Avalanche Warning Services agreed to introduce a
      uniform avalanche danger scale. The common scale defines the danger level
      based on snowpack stability and avalanche release probability. The
      complete description of the scale also contains additional, not
      internationally agreed columns on typical characteristics, recommendations
      and effects.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a
        href="https://www.avalanches.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/European_Avalanche_Danger_Scale-EAWS.pdf"
        target="_blank"
        >European Avalanche Danger Scale PDF</a
      >
    </p>

    <h6>
      The avalanche danger levels - a simplified representation of the complex
      processes in nature.
    </h6>

    <p>
      The European Avalanche Danger Scale is a five-level, ordinarily ascending,
      categorical scale. Ordinary ascending means that the scale has a ordinary
      ascending ranking. Categorical means that the scale consists of classes
      which - even if they are expressed with the numbers 1-5 - may not simply
      be processed mathematically. For example, the danger level
      3&nbsp;–&nbsp;considerable is not simply higher by one than danger level
      2&nbsp;–&nbsp;moderate, because the avalanche danger probably increases
      disproportionately (i.e. not linearly). In other words, danger level
      3&nbsp;–&nbsp;considerable is not one level higher than
      2&nbsp;–&nbsp;moderate, but probably twice as high. The danger levels must
      not be added either.
    </p>

    <h6>Definitions in the European avalanche danger scale</h6>

    <p>
      In the definition of the danger scale, the characteristics of the
      avalanche danger are defined for each level with the parameters
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Probability of avalanche release,</li>
      <li>Distribution of hazardous sites and</li>
      <li>Size and frequency of expected avalanches</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The changes or the combination of these input variables determine the
      avalanche danger level. Avalanche forecasters in Europe have agreed to use
      the EAWS matrix for a more harmonised determination of the danger levels.
      In order to do so, they take the three parameters probability of avalanche
      release, distribution of hazardous sites and size and frequency of the
      expected avalanches into account. In the case of avalanche danger
      1&nbsp;–&nbsp;low, for example, small avalanches should only be triggered
      in a few places and usually only with a high additional load, whereas in
      the case of avalanche danger 4&nbsp;–&nbsp;high many and sometimes also
      very large avalanches are likely to be triggered with to low additional
      loads (e.g. skiers) or may release spontaneously. The European avalanche
      danger level scale consists of five levels. In nature, however, the
      avalanche danger changes continuously and rises disproportionately.

      Figure 1: The natural course of avalanche danger (blue line) increases
      non-linearly. The categorical nature of the danger levels must therefore
      always reflect a range of natural avalanche danger conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore the avalanche danger can have very different characteristics
      within a danger level. This range is most apparent at hazard level
      3&nbsp;–&nbsp;considerable. At the upper limit of this danger level many
      alarm signs are observed (whumphs, shooting cracks, fresh avalanches) and
      the danger is very present. At the lower limit of this danger level these
      clear indications are missing. Often - mostly unconsciously - this leads
      to riskier terrain choices.
    </p>

    <h6>Frequency of danger levels</h6>

    <p>
      In the assessment area of the avalanche.report, danger level
      2&nbsp;–&nbsp;moderate is forecast in almost half of the days (per warning
      region). This danger level is most frequently used. It thus describes a
      day with average avalanche danger. Level 3&nbsp;–&nbsp;considerable is
      issued on about one third of the days. This is where most fatal accidents
      occur (approx. 50&nbsp;%). The danger level 4&nbsp;–&nbsp;high is issued
      on average only on 2&nbsp;% of winter days, i.e. on approx. 2-4 days per
      season. Level 5&nbsp;–&nbsp;very&nbsp;high is reserved for catastrophic
      situations and is therefore rarely used.
    </p>

    <h2>Various characteristics of avalanche danger</h2>

    <h6>Small, easy to trigger wind slabs</h6>

    <p>
      A single backcountry recreationist can often trigger fresh drifting-snow
      accumulations. The size of these so-called wind slabs depends not only on
      the wind, but also on the supply of fresh snow or a loosely bonded old
      snow surface. The size of the wind slabs depends on the amount of Wind
      slab and the wind speed itself. In case only small amounts of snow can be
      transported, wind slabs remain rather small. If skier trigger these small
      wind slabs, avalanches tend to remain rather small. Consequently, deep
      burials are unlikely. Although release probability in this example may be
      quite high, forecaster assesses these conditions to a danger level
      2&nbsp;–&nbsp;moderate. With a certain amount of training accumulations
      with Wind slab can usually be assessed fairly easy when good visibility
      prevails. In general, wind slabs should be avoided especially on terrain
      where slipping and falling may have fatal consequences.
    </p>

    <h6>Deep persistent weak layers</h6>

    <p>
      Deeply buried persistent weak layers (e.g. buried surface hoar, basal
      facets formed with cold on warm / warm on cold) are hard to trigger, since
      it is very difficult to initiate a fracture. Triggering of deep persistent
      weak layers may most likely occur where the snow is relatively shallow or
      at transitions from shallow to deep snow (see also shallow snow next to
      deep snow). In the case a persistent weak layer problem prevails with a
      prominent persistent weak layer deep down in the snowpack. Hazardous
      sites, where a single skier may initiate a fracture are relatively rare.
      However, in case of fracture initiation, avalanches may often become
      dangerously large for backcountry recreationists – with other words often
      fatal. Therefore, avalanche forecaster rate these situations often with
      avalanche danger 3&nbsp;–&nbsp;considerable, even though locations for
      triggering an avalanche are rarely distributed. The situation is fairly
      complected to assess for backcountry recreationists since triggering
      locations are often very hard to detect, even with advanced skills and
      trained eye. The persistent weak layer problem produces more avalanche
      fatalities than any other typical avalanche problem.
    </p>

    <h6>4&nbsp;–&nbsp;High with many skier-triggered avalanches</h6>

    <p>
      If numerous large and, in many cases, very large spontaneous avalanches
      are expected, the avalanche danger is rated with 4&nbsp;–&nbsp;high. Under
      such conditions, exposed locations (usually sections of transport routes,
      and in isolated cases also buildings) are at risk. In addition to this
      classical characteristics of avalanche danger level 4&nbsp;–&nbsp;high,
      there is a further variant where large avalanches are hardly expected
      (e.g. because there is still too little snow at the start of the winter)
      but a lot of medium and large avalanches are naturally released and/or can
      be triggered very easily at multiple locations. In this case, avalanche
      forecasters speak about a 'skier 4&nbsp;–&nbsp;high'. These situations
      represent a sever danger for backcountry recreationists, while transport
      routes remain unaffected or only affected in isolated cases.
    </p>

    <h6>Wet and glide-snow avalanche activity</h6>

    <p>
      Wet-snow avalanches are hardly triggered by skiers, while in the case of
      glide-snow avalanches this is virtually impossible. Therefore, natural
      triggering is the main cause of these avalanche types - even in the case
      of the lower danger levels. In fact, the definitions of the maximum
      possible spontaneous avalanche activity at the lower end of the avalanche
      danger scale relates mainly to wet-snow and glide-snow avalanches. In this
      context large spontaneous avalanches are possible when there is a
      2&nbsp;–&nbsp;moderate avalanche danger for conditions causing wet-snow or
      glide-snow avalanches. In the case of a conditions causing dry-snow
      avalanches, such naturally triggered avalanche activity normally
      corresponds to a 3&nbsp;–&nbsp;considerable avalanche danger, as then
      avalanches are also expected to be triggered by individuals.
