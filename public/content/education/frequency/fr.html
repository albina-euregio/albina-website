<p><a href="/education/snowpack-stability">Snowpack stability</a>, along with the frequency distribution of snowpack stability and &#13;
  <a href="/education/avalanche-sizes">avalanche size</a>, is one of the key contributors &#13;
  when assessing the <a href="/education/danger-scale">avalanche danger level</a> using the &#13;
  <a href="/education/matrix">EAWS Matrix</a>.&#13;
  Since the EAWS General Assemby in Davos in June 2022, all three variables were defined and underpinned &#13;
  with examples used in practice. Definitons, remarks, examples and more in-depth information for the variable &#13;
  frequency distribution of snowpack stability can be found in the following sections or on <a href="www.avalananches.org/standards/">avalanches.org</a></p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Definition</h6>&#13;
    <p>The frequency distribution of snowpack stability describes the percentages of points &#13;
      for each stability class relative to all points in avalanche terrain. Thus, the frequency <i>f</i> for all &#13;
      points with stability class <i>i</i> (n<sub><i>i</i></sub>) compared to all points (<i>n</i>) is <i>f(i)</i>&#13;
       = <i>n</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>/<i>n</i>. The frequency distribution &#13;
      of snowpack stability is described using four classes: &#13;
      <i>Many</i>, <i>Some</i>, <i>A Few</i>, and <i>None or Nearly None</i> (Table 1).</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Remarks</h6>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>The frequency distribution of snowpack stability refers to (many) points &#13;
      (i.e., stability tests, snowpack models or potential triggering locations) or avalanche starting zones.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>The frequency must be assessed for a warning region which must be equal to or larger &#13;
      than the <a href="/education/spatio-temporal-scale">reference unit</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>The definition asks, in theory, for a percentage. However, this is often impossible to assess since &#13;
      the frequency distribution must often be inferred from sparse data in a real situation. Percentages or &#13;
      thresholds for<i>Many</i>, <i>Some</i>, <i>A Few</i>, and <i>None or Nearly None</i> differ depending on &#13;
      the measurement/evidence used or available (see below for more details). For instance, the percentages for &#13;
      slopes that produce spontaneous avalanches might be lower than the percentage of points with stability &#13;
      tests that indicate <i>Very Poor</i> stability.</p>&#13;

    <h2>Considerations when assigning classes of frequency distributions of snowpack stability</h2>&#13;
    &#13;
    <p>Figure 1 illustrates the concept of frequency distribution. t shows an idealized case. We consider a hypothetical and idealized &#13;
      scenario where a stability assessment for points within starting zones is available. &#13;
      Here, our micro-region is defined by the contour map in panel a). For the sake of simplicity, we choose &#13;
      the reference unit to be equal to the micro-region. Thus, considering all points in the starting zones &#13;
      within the region independent of elevation, aspect or other possible subdivisions (Panel b). &#13;
      Panel c) shows the stability class assessed in each point. Panel d) shows the resulting &#13;
      frequency distribution of these stability classes. Generally, the frequency of the weakest stability &#13;
      class, in this case <i>Very Poos</i>, needs to be considered to determine the danger level.</p>&#13;

&#13;
    <p>The challenge of assigning percentages, or deciding on thresholds between classes, has been debated a lot &#13;
      and researchers and practicioners have no clear answer, yet. Few forecasters or practicioners have &#13;
      enough data available that is conclusive and evenly distributed over relevant release areas in the &#13;
      region they are assessing. Therefore, assigning a frequency distribution class remains an expert opinion &#13;
      and experience for the time to come. The avalanche forecasting community believes that much more data in combination with verification &#13;
      campaigns needs to be assessed before we can provide good answers. In the following paragraphs, we list &#13;
      some studies that tried to quantify the frequency distribution of snowpack stability in one way or another. &#13;
      The presented numbers are currently the best estimates we have describing the frequency distribution of &#13;
      snowpack stability. They have different bases and cannot be compared directly or combined to describe &#13;
      classes uniformly. More studies of this type need to be conducted in the future to provide reliable &#13;
      percentages for the frequency of snowpack stability.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Stability tests (Rutschblock)</h6>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>Frequency classes derived by <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/14/3503/2020/tc-14-3503-2020.html">&#13;
      Techel et al. (2020)</a> for the frequency of the Rutschblock stability class very poor:</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <ul>
<li>
<i>Many</i>: &amp;gt20%</li>&#13;
     <li>
<i>Some</i>: &amp;gt4% - 20%</li>&#13;
     <li>
<i>A Few</i>: &amp;gt0% - &amp;lt4%</li>&#13;
     <li>
<i>None or Nearly None</i>: 0%</li>&#13;
    </ul>
<h6>Avalanche activity (Example 1)</h6>&#13;
    <p>Avalanche activity, as observed from satellite images over Switzerland in two extreme avalanche situations &#13;
      in January 2018 and January 2019 (Hafner, 2019): The proportion of potential release areas which was &#13;
      active (which avalanched) varied for a subset of 13 micro-regions between 4% and 23% with a mean of 13%. &#13;
      These micro-regions cover a surface area between 56 and 506 km<sup>2</sup>, while the potential release &#13;
      area within these micro-regions covers between 21 and 159 km<sup>2</sup> of the surface area of these &#13;
      regions. When only considering the two most active neighboring 45&amp;#8451-aspects within these regions &#13;
      (e.g. from NW-N-NE), the observed maximum was 41% of the total release area being active. These values can &#13;
      be considered representing high values for the term <i>Many</i>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>Avalanche activity (Example 2)</h6>&#13;
    <p>Based on a 15-year data set of manually mapped natural avalanches in the region of Davos, &#13;
      Switzerland (Völk, 2020), the following frequency classes were obtained using the approach described &#13;
      by <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/14/3503/2020/tc-14-3503-2020.html">&#13;
        Techel et al. (2020)</a> for the proportion of potential release areas which were active &#13;
      (which avalanched):</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <ul>
<li>
<i>Many</i>: &amp;gt2.2%</li>&#13;
     <li>
<i>Some</i>: &amp;gt0.02% - 2.2%</li>&#13;
     <li>
<i>A Few</i>: &amp;lt0.02%</li>&#13;
    </ul>
<p>Note, the latter mapping approach has a comparably low detection rate &#13;
      <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/15/983/2021/">(Hafner et al. 2021)</a>. As an estimate, these class thresholds may be too low by a factor of around 2.</p>&#13;
