    <strong>ATTENTION:</strong> DRIVING ON FOREST TRACKS DURING THE WINTER AND SPRING MONTHS IS THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF
    DRIVERS. THIS PRACTICE REQUIRES EXPERIENCE IN ASSESSING CONDITIONS AND IN DRIVING. IT IS ADVISABLE TO BRING SNOW TIRES, BE
    EQUIPPED WITH CHAINS, INFORM SOMEONE OF YOUR ROUTE AND AVOID GOING ALONE.
