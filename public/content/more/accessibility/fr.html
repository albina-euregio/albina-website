<section class="section-centered"><div class="panel">&#13;
    <p>Pursuant to Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1523 of 11 October&#13;
      2018 establishing a model accessibility statement in accordance with&#13;
      Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council on&#13;
      barrier-free access to the websites and mobile applications of public&#13;
      sector bodies.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h4>Declaration on accessibility</h4>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>The Office of the Tyrolean Regional Government endeavours to make its&#13;
      website accessible in accordance with Section 14b of the Tyrolean&#13;
      Anti-Discrimination Act 2005 implementing Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the&#13;
      European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2016 on barrier-free&#13;
      access to the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies (OJ&#13;
      L 327, 2.12.2016, p. 1).</p>&#13;
    <p>This accessibility statement applies to "Avalanche.report" |&#13;
      "Avalanche.report" | "Valanghe.report".</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h4>Status of compatibility with the requirements</h4>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>This website is partially compliant with compliance level AA of the "Web&#13;
      Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG 2.1" according to the applicable&#13;
      harmonised European standard "European Standard EN 301 549 V2.1.2&#13;
      (2018-08)" due to the following incompatibilities.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h5>Non-accessible content</h5>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>The content listed below is not accessible for the following reasons:</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>1. Incompatibility with accessibility regulations.</h6>&#13;
&#13;
    <h7>1.1 Perceptibility</h7><p>For some images in blog entries the alternative text is missing, so this&#13;
      information is not accessible for screen reader users. This means that&#13;
      WCAG success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content) is not met. All new images&#13;
      are published together with alternative text.</p>&#13;
    <p>Some pages are missing level 2, 3, 4 and 5 headings, thus WCAG success&#13;
      criteria 1.3.1 (info and relationships) is not met. We plan to fix the&#13;
      problem in 2021.</p>&#13;
    <p>On some pages, the minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 of text and images of&#13;
      text is not met. This means that WCAG success criterion 1.3.3 Contrast&#13;
      (minimum) is not met.</p>&#13;
    <p>Images and graphics are used to provide weather and climate content in a&#13;
      compact and effective way. For technical reasons and due to the high&#13;
      update rates of the files to be visualised, we are not able to design all&#13;
      illustrations and graphics in an accessible and barrier-free manner and in&#13;
      these cases do not fulfil success criterion 1.1.1 (text alternative). This&#13;
      includes animated weather forecasts and analyses.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <h6>2. Disproportionate burden</h6>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>Our videos do not have audio description. This means that WCAG success&#13;
      criterion 1.2.5 (audio description recorded) is not met. The content of&#13;
      the video is available in textual form directly with the videos.</p>&#13;
&#13;
