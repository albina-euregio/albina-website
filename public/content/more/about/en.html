      Passionate backcountry recreationists from Tirol, South Tyrol and Trentino
      are discovering more and more tours throughout the so-called Euregio. In
      order to guarantee maximum safety, avalanche warning services from the
      three states/provinces Tirol, South Tyrol and Trentino have joined forces
      to publish a joint, multilingual and cross-border avalanche forecast
      starting from the 2018-2019 winter season. In addition, there are maps of
      snow and new snow height, air temperature, wind and wind gust.

    <h2>The idea: a common project</h2>
    <p>
      For some time now there has been the idea of bringing the avalanche
      warning services of the so-called Euregio region closer together. Since
      January 2017 the Interreg project ALBINA Euregio-Avalanche Bulletin on the
      Interreg project Italia-Austria was approved and work on this project
      started.<br />The project's main goal was the realization of a joint
      multilingual avalanche forecast designed to daily inform citizens about
      the avalanche situation in the entire Euregio territory. In order to
      achieve this, the project aimed at standardizing the work of the avalanche
      forecasters through a unified workflow based on EAWS standards for the
      preparation of the avalanche forecast while organizing apposite periodic
      training. Communication structures developed within the project promote
      and facilitate the exchange of information among experts of the three
      territories, thanks to a software system that displays the weather station
      data, observations, snow profiles and avalanche activity of the whole
      region and enables publishing of the common avalanche forecast. <br />The
      exchange of information occurs through standardized interfaces and formats
      that facilitate future extensions and connections. The Euregio avalanche
      forecast is presented on a website in an intuitive and uniform way thanks
      to optimized mapping and descriptions based on predefined text blocks.
      Standardized interfaces with the media and social networks facilitate the
      broadcast of the forecast. All data is freely accessible thus supporting
      the Open Data initiative. This first cross-border avalanche forecast is a
      decisive step forward in risk prevention and management in the Euregio
      territory.

    <h2>The project partners</h2>
    <p>
      The Euregio region Tirol, South Tyrol, Trentino (EGTC) developed the
      project together with the Avalanche Warning Services of the Province of
      Tyrol, the Autonomous Provinces of Bolzano-South Tyrol and Trento and the
      University of Vienna and submitted it to the administrative authority of
      Bolzano on 6 June 2016 for funding under the INTERREG V-A programme
      Italy-Austria. The project was approved at the meeting of the Monitoring
      Committee on 27-28 September 2016.

          The European Region Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino directly expresses the
          cross-border cooperation by interlinking the most different areas of
          life such as transport, agriculture, education or culture of the three
          states/provinces. The idea of deepening political, economic and
          cultural life is applied in practice and leads to numerous fruitful
          projects.

          The Avalanche Warning Service Tirol is part of the Department of Civil
          Protection and Disaster Relief and has been informing the public about
          the current snow and avalanche situation in the Tyrolean Mountains for
          more than 50 years. The Avalanche Warning Service collects, evaluates
          and interprets a wide range of information on snow cover and weather.
          All information and interpretations ultimately lead to the central
          warning product of the Avalanche Warning Service, the avalanche
          report.

          The Avalanche Warning Service South Tyrol is located at the Office for
          Meteorology and Avalanche Forecasting South Tyrol. It provides all
          snow and mountain enthusiasts as well as local authorities and
          avalanche commissions with up-to-date data and forecasts of the
          avalanche danger. For this purpose, automatic and manual measurement
          data, snow profiles and observations are analyzed and evaluated.
          Combined with the weather forecasts of the Provincial Weather Service,
          a daily forecast of the avalanche danger is published in the winter
          season.

          The Avalanche Warning Service Trentino is part of the Civil Protection
          and Disaster Management Office of the Autonomous Province of Trento.
          The warning service, better known as Meteotrentino, publishes weather
          and snow cover information for all Trentino residents, tourists and
          local safety authorities and avalanche commissions. In order to
          fulfill this responsibility, but above all to assess the avalanche
          danger, the warning service has an extensive network of automatic
          weather stations, snow measuring fields and observers. These are used
          to obtain various measurements and observations to assess the snow
          cover.
